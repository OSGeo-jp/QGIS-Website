"Environmental issues, such as the climate crisis, the rapid decrease of "
"biodiversity, and pollution are pressing issues for everyone in the "
"Geoscience community and beyond. Many QGIS users and contributors are "
"geoscientists or geoinformatics specialists. As such, we need to act "
"responsibly and serve as role models. If we act, there is a chance that "
"the members of the general public that are less informed about these "
"issues will also feel the urgency to act and help reduce the impact of "
"human activity on our planet."

"*Choice of location:* ​when choosing the location for a contributor "

"*Traveling to the meeting:*​ when feasible, participants should be "
"encouraged to choose more environmentally friendly transport options: "
"preferably trains or buses rather than planes. When choosing transport by"
" car, car pooling should be encouraged. QGIS.ORG has a program allowing "
"contributor meeting participants to ask for travel expenses "
