"<p>QGIS Contributors Meetings are volunteer-driven events where "
"contributors to the QGIS project from around the world get together in a "
"common space &#8211; usually a university campus. During these events, "
"contributors to the QGIS project take the opportunity to plan their work,"
" hold face-to-face discussions and present new improvements to the QGIS "
"project that they have been working on. Everybody attending the event "
"donates their time to the project for the days of the event. As a project"
" that is built primarily through online collaboration, these meetings "
"provide a crucial ingredient to the future development of the QGIS "
"project. The event is planned largely as an ‘unconference’ with minimal "
"structured programme planning. We do this to allow attendees the freedom "
"to meet dynamically with those they encounter at the event. Those "
"sessions that are planned are advertised on the event web page and we try"
" to enable remote participation through video conferencing software. "
"Although our hosts are not funded and donate the working space to us, we "
"show our appreciation by making one of our software release’s splash "
"screens in honour of that host, which is a great way to gain exposure of "
"your institution and country to the hundreds of thousands of users that "
"make use of QGIS.</p>\n"
