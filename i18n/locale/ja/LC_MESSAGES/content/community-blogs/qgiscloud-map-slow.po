"QGIS Cloud Support is repeatedly asked: ‘Why is my QGIS Cloud map so slow"
" and what can I do to make it faster?’ Basically, the bottlenecks can be "
"traced back to poor data management and/or a slow internet connection. In"
" this short blog article, I would like to give you a few tips on what you"
" can do to speed up a slow loading map. Optimise the data Make sure that "
"your database is optimised and that you only use the necessary data in "
"your web map."
