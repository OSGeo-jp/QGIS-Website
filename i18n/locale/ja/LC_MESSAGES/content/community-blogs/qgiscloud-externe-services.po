"The use of WMS/WMTS layers in a QGIS Cloud map project can significantly "
"degrade the performance of the map display. I have already discussed how "
"to counter this problem in an earlier post. One of the solutions is to "
"load external WMS as background layers. The problem with this approach, "
"however, is that only one WMS background layer can be loaded at a time. "
"If further WMS layers are to be loaded into the map at the same time, "
"this approach cannot be used."
