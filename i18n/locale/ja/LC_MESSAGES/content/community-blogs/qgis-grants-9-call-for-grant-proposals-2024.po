"<p>Dear QGIS Community,</p>\n"
"<p>We are very pleased to announce that this year’s round of grants is "
"now available. The call is open to anybody who wants to make a "
"contribution to QGIS funded by our grant fund, subject to the call "
"conditions outlined in the application form.</p>\n"
"<p>The deadline for this round is in four weeks, on <strong>14 March "
"2024</strong>.</p>\n"
"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are no new procedures in 2024. "
"Please note the following guidelines established in previous years: "
"</span></p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The "
"proposal must be submitted as a ‘QEP’ (QGIS Enhancement Proposal) issue "
"in the repo: </span><a href=\"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-"
"Proposals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://github.com/qgis"
"/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> "
"(tagged as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grant-2024</span><span"
" style=\"font-weight: 400\">). Following this approach will allow "
"</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">people to ask questions and "
"provide public feedback on individual proposals.</span></li>\n"
"<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proposals"
" must clearly define the expected final result so that we can properly "
"assess if the goal of the proposal has been reached.</span></li>\n"
"<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The "
"project budgets should account for PR reviewing expenses to ensure timely"
" handling of the project-related PRs and avoid delays caused by relying "
"on reviewer volunteer time. </span></li>\n"
"<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the "
"week after the QEP discussion period, the proposal authors are expected "
"to write a short summary of the discussion that is suitable for use as a "
"basis on which voting members make their decisions. </span></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The PSC of QGIS.ORG will examine the "
"proposals and has veto power in case a proposal does not follow "
"guidelines or is not in line with project priorities. </span></p>\n"
"<p>For more details, please read the introduction provided in <a "
"href=\"https://forms.gle/ydFS8RnL7Dt46MVx7\"><strong>the application "
"form</strong></a>.</p>\n"
"<p>We look forward to seeing all your great ideas for improving QGIS!</p>"
