"<p>This new release introduces <strong>project-defined tracking sessions,"
" which are automatically activated when the project is loaded</strong>. "
"Defined while setting up and tweaking a project on QGIS, these sessions "
"permit the automated tracking of device positions without taking any "
"action in QField beyond opening the project itself. This liberates field "
"users from remembering to launch a session on app launch and lowers the "
"knowledge required to collect such data. For more details, please read "
"the <a href=\"https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/tracking/#configure-a"
"-project-tracking-session\">relevant QField documentation "
"section</a>.</p>\n"

"<p>First, cloud projects can now automatically push accumulated changes "

"cloud project by going to the synchronization panel in QField and "
"activating the relevant toggle (see middle screenshot above). It can also"
" be turned on project load by enabling automatic push when setting up the"
" project in QGIS via the project properties dialog. When activated "
"through this project setting, the functionality will always be activated,"
" and the need for field users to take any action will be removed.</p>\n"
