"<p>Growing up, I would spend hours lost in National Geographic maps. The "
"feeling of discovering new regions and new ways to view the world was "
"addictive! It&#8217;s this same feeling of discovery and exploration "
"which has made me super excited about <a "
"href=\"https://soar.earth/\">Soar’s Digital Atlas</a>. Soar is the "
"brainchild of Australian, <a href=\"https://about.soar.earth/team\">Amir "
"Farhand</a>, and is fuelled by the talents of staff located across the "
"globe to build a comprehensive digital atlas of the world’s maps and "
"images. Soar has been designed to be an easy to use, expansive collection"
" of diverse maps from all over the Earth. A great aspect of Soar is that "
"it has implemented Strong Community Guidelines and moderation to ensure "
"the maps are fit for purpose.</p>\n"
"<p>Recently, North Road collaborated with Soar to help facilitate their "
"digital atlas goals by creating a QGIS plugin for <strong>Soar</strong>. "
"The <a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/soar/\">Soar plugin</a> "
"allows QGIS users to directly:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Export their QGIS maps and images straight to "
"Soar</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Browse and load maps from the entire Soar public "
"catalogue into their QGIS projects</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>There&#8217;s lots of extra tweaks we&#8217;ve added to help make the "
"plugin user friendly, whilst offering tons of functionality that power "
"users want. For instance, users can:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Filter Soar maps by their current project extent "
"and/or by category</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Export raw or rendered raster data directly to Soar "
"via a Processing tool</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Batch upload multiple maps to Soar</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Incorporate Soar map publishing into a Processing "
"model or Python based workflow</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p><em>Soar will be presenting their new plugin at the <a "
"href=\"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QOD-August-2023\">QGIS Open "
"Day</a> in August so check out the details <a "
"href=\"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QOD-August-2023\">here</a> and "
"tune in at 2300 AEST or 1300 HR UTC. You can follow along via either <a "
"href=\"https://youtube.com/live/Nm1TeYG4euk?feature=share\" "
"rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a> or <a "
"href=\"https://meet.jit.si/OkVillagesRecordHappily\" "
"rel=\"nofollow\">Jitsi</a>.</em></p>\n"
"<h3>Browsing Soar maps from QGIS</h3>\n"
"<p>One of the main goals of the Soar QGIS plugin was to make it very easy"
" to find new datasets and add them to your QGIS projects. There&#8217;s "
"two ways users can explore the Soar catalog from QGIS:</p>\n"
"<p>You can open the Soar Browser Panel via the Soar toolbar button  <img "
"decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-212593 "
"alignnone\" src=\"https://north-road.com/wp-"
"content/uploads/2023/08/soar_load_browser.png\" alt=\"Soar browser\" "
"width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /> . This opens a floating catalog browser "
"panel which allows you to interactively search Soar&#8217;s content while"
" working on your map.</p>\n"

"<p>Alternatively, you can also access the Soar catalog and maps from the "
"standard QGIS Data Source Manager dialog. Just open the "
"&#8220;Soar&#8221; tab and search away!</p>\n"
"<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-"

"alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"901\" /></p>\n"
"<p>When you&#8217;ve found an interesting map, hit the &#8220;Add to "
"Map&#8221; button and the map will be added as a new layer into your "
"current project. After the layer is loaded you can freely modify the "
"layer&#8217;s style (such as the opacity, colorization, contrast etc) "
"just like any other raster dataset using the standard QGIS Layer Style "
"controls.</p>\n"
"<h2>Sharing your maps</h2>\n"
"<p>Before you can share your maps on Soar, you&#8217;ll need to first <a "
"href=\"https://soar.earth/register?\">sign up</a> for a free Soar "
"account.</p>\n"
"<p>We&#8217;ve designed the Soar plugin with two specific use cases in "
"mind for sharing maps. The first use case is when you want to share an "
"entire map (i.e. QGIS project) to Soar. This will publish all the visible"
" content from your map onto Soar, including all the custom styling, "
"labeling, decorations and other content you&#8217;ve carefully designed. "
"To do this, just select the Project menu, Import/Export -&gt; Export map "
"to Soar option.</p>\n"

"text explaining your map, and then the map will be rendered and uploaded "
"directly to Soar.</p>\n"

"<p>All content on the Soar atlas is moderated, so your shared maps get "
"added to the moderation queue ready for review by the Soar team. "
"(You&#8217;ll be notified as soon as the review is complete and your map "
"is publicly available).</p>\n"
"<p>Alternatively, you might have a specific raster layer which you want "
"to publish on Soar. For instance, you&#8217;ve completed some flood "
"modelling or vegetation analysis and want to share the outcome widely. To"
" do this, you can use the &#8220;Publish dataset to Soar&#8221; tool "
"available from the QGIS Processing toolbox:</p>\n"

"<p>Just pick the raster layer you want to upload, enter the metadata "
"information, and let the plugin do the rest! Since this tool is made "
"available through QGIS&#8217; Processing framework, it also allows you to"
" run it as a batch process (eg uploading a whole folder of raster data to"
" Soar), or as a step in your QGIS Graphical Models!</p>\n"
"<h4>Some helpful hints</h4>\n"
"<p>All maps uploaded to Soar require the following information:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Map Title</li>\n"
"<li>Description</li>\n"
"<li>Tags</li>\n"
"<li>Categories</li>\n"
"<li>Permission to publish</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>This helps other users to find your maps with ease, and also gives the"
" Soar moderation team the information required for their review "
"process.</p>\n"
"<p>We&#8217;ve a few other tips to keep in mind to successfully share "
"your maps on Soar:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">The Soar catalog currently works with raster image "
"formats including GeoTIFF / ECW / JP2 / JPEG / PNG</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">All data uploaded to Soar must be in the WGS84 "
"Pseudo-Mercator (EPSG: 3857) projection</li>\n"
"<li aria-level=\"1\">Check the size of your data before sharing it, as a "
"large size dataset may take a long time to upload</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>So there you have it! So simple to start building up your contribution"
" to Soar&#8217;s Digital Atlas. Those who might find this useful to "
"upload maps include:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Community groups</li>\n"
"<li>Hobbyists</li>\n"
"<li>Building a cartographic/geospatial portfolio</li>\n"
"<li>Education/research</li>\n"
"<li>Contributing to world events (some of the biggest news agencies "
"already use this service i.e. BBC)</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>You can find out more about the QGIS Soar plugin at the QGIS Open Day "
"on August 23rd, 2023 at 2300 HR AEST or 1300 HR UTC. Check <a "
"href=\"https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QOD-August-2023\">here</a> for "
"more information or to watch back after.</p>\n"
"<p>If you&#8217;re interested in exploring how a QGIS plugin can make "
"your service easily accessible to the millions of daily QGIS users, <a "
