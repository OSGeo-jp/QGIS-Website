"<p>Users now have the flexibility to utilize a variety of distance units "
"in the stake out mode, moving beyond the conventional meters. This "
"enhancement allows for a more customized and user-friendly experience, "
"catering to diverse geographic contexts and preferences. </p><p>To "
"configure these distance units, navigate to QGIS project settings and "
"change “distance units“ to your preferred units.  </p><p>For detailed "
"instructions on how to set up and leverage alternative distance units in "
"stakeout mode, refer to our documentation <a "
