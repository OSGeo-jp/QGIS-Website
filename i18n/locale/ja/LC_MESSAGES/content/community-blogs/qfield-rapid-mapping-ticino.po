"<p>Photographing <strong>damaged houses and infrastructure</strong> is "
"the most critical aspect of this mapping initiative. These images provide"
" crucial information for assessing the extent of the damage, planning "
"rescue and reconstruction operations, and ensuring that resources are "
"allocated effectively. It&#8217;s also important to document any "
"<strong>submerged or damaged vehicles</strong>, as they offer additional "
"insights into the disaster&#8217;s impact. During these activities, "
"it&#8217;s essential to be careful and respect the privacy and property "
"of others, <strong>avoiding capturing license plate numbers or entering "
"destroyed buildings</strong> without permission. Using QField Rapid "
"Mapper can contribute to a faster and more coordinated emergency response"
