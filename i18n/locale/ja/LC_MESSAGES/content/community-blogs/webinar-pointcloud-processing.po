"<h2 id=\"description\">Description</h2>\n"
"<p>Point clouds are an increasingly popular data type thanks to the "
"decreasing cost of their acquisition through lidar surveys and "
"photogrammetry. On top of that, more and more national mapping agencies "
"release high resolution point cloud data (spanning large areas and "
"consisting of billions of points), unlocking many new use cases.</p>\n"

"<p>This webinar will summarize the latest QGIS release 3.32 and the "
"addition of tools for point cloud analysis right from QGIS Processing "
"toolbox: clip, filter, merge, export to raster, extract boundaries and "
"more - all backed by PDAL library that already ships with QGIS, without "
"having to rely on third party proprietary software.</p>\n"
