"Ever since the consolidation of the Department of Geography in 2012, we "
"have tried to incorporate open source software to fulfill our duties. In "
"particular, the management of an extensive field work, consisting in the "
"annual implementation of approximately 40,000 visits to socially "
"vulnerable households throughout the country. The objective was to "
"conform a thorough georeferenced database of target households, in order "
"to improve social policies implementation. Particularly, data was "
"collected to enhance the scope of monetary transfer programs "
"([\\\"Asignaciones Familiares -- Plan de "

"Although proprietary software was implemented when the working process "
"started, the development of the tasks themselves gradually demanded it to"
" be converted to open source software. As the process as a whole became "
"more computerized -incorporating a workflow engine and a PostGIS "
"geospatial database-, license requirements and benefits offered by free "
"and open source software (FOSS) options encouraged us to make the change."
" In that way, as the QGIS project was refined (fewer bugs and more "
"functionalities), we were able to satisfy our needs using QGIS. PostGIS "
"associated tools allowed the workgroup to rapidly coordinate the tasks "
"needed to viabilize daily field trips, together with subsequent analysis "
"tasks on the same data fieldwork generated, shortly after it was relieved"
" and digitized."

"In addition to information management and field work implementation, we "
"constantly use QGIS typical geospatial tools to produce tematic "
"cartography, and in spatial analysis tasks. This last, as much about the "
"data that the fieldwork generates, as with other ministry programs "
"information, and frequently even to aid interinstitutional projects. With"
" [\\\"qgis2web\\\"](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis2web/) we were "
"able to produce interactive maps, which have become the main way to "
"communicate the results of such investigations. They allow human "
"resources within other programs and agencies to easily and effectively "
"manage higher amounts of information than with a collection of static "
"maps, even when these resources are not used to reading spatial data."

msgid ""
"QGIS has become a fundamental software to the Department of Geography at "
"DINEM. It presents an excellent performance to work with heavy files and "
"to interact with PostGIS and with our workflow engine. This allows us to "
"have an excellent management of geographic data, which also makes for the"
" production of basemaps and thematic cartographies of superior quality."

"At the same time, extra features that are incorporated through plugins "
"are of great value to us. For instance, the possibility of exporting "
"\\\"leaflet\\\" map viewers, as well as incorporating high resolution "
"satellite imagery directly into the GIS work area through \"OpenLayers\" "
"to manually vectorize information, among others."

"This variety of options is precisely what has allowed us to develop the "
"specific and at the same time very different technical solutions that "
"programs and agencies have been needing through past years.As mentioned "
"in this article, we can state that QGIS meets the necessary requirements "
"to be used in public administration as desktop GIS software. Also it has "
"been a cornerstone in helping this institution to set up a web map, "
"offering general population much information about social issues ([SIG "
"MIDES](https://mapas.mides.gub.uy/), OpenLayers based WEB GIS developed "
"by the IT division)."
