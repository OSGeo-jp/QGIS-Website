"Using QGIS for urban planning in the municipality of Montecchio Maggiore,"

"Montecchio Maggiore is a small town in the middle west of Vicenza (about "
"24.000 population). And as many other italian municipality it manages the"
" town planning; in particular the urban planning and what we call "
"\"recovery plan\" aka PDR \\-\\-- Piani Di Recupero. This urbanistic tool"
" is dedicated to the historical area in the center of the town and it "
"requires a specific study: building state of conservation, intended use, "
"particular historical notice via survey and restitution to produce "
"planimetric and prospectus graphics. For this purpose it has used QGIS in"
" addition to Postgresql/Postgis database, PHP code and Libreoffice suite,"
" QCAD (LibreCAD)."

"Every building data was retrieved via survey and written in paper "

"Postgresql/Postgis database via PHP form using canonical web browser "

"building was draw with QGIS and linked to the survey table via id key "
"field (PostgreSQL/Postgis view)."

"Thus a photo was linked to every building facilitating the design and "

"volume calculation split by building intended use, standards area "
"calculation in percentage of the total planning area and other minor "
"queries. All useful items for the design and planning study otherwise not"

"The strength of QGIS is the very user friendly interface coupled with the"
" several tools it offers. The connection with vary data formats (shape "
"files, spatialite db, postgresql/postgis db,\\...) facilitates and "
"increases the interoperability between different worlds. And thus the "
"freedom offered by the free software (QGIS, PHP, Libreoffice, QCAD) "
"stimulates and open new horizons."
