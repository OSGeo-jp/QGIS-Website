"The historical maps are important documents even if its precision cannot "
"be compared to the precision of the actual cartographic document, and "
"they are very communicative representations also for those who are not "
"specialists on geographic representations. QGIS was the only means that "
"allowed me to use the numerical content of the historical maps according "
"to an effective and meaningful representation."
