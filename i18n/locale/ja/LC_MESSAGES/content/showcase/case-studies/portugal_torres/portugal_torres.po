"The Associação Leonel Trindade -- Sociedade de História Natural (ALT-SHN)"
" is a non profit institution headquarted in Torres Vedras, Portugal, "
"specialized in paleontology. The institution manages a large fossil "
"collection, mainly from Upper Jurassic. One of the key issues in "
"paleontological management is to assess spatial context of the sites from"
" where the fossils are retrieved -- hundreds of sites representing "
"thousands of different specimens."

"Back in 2008, we came up with the idea of exploring GIS technologies to "
"support the investigation and get a more holistic perspective on the "
"heritage we were dealing. This idea boosted SIGAP Project (GIS applied to"

"entities -- mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army\\'s "
"Geographic Institute (IGeoE), aimed three goals:"

"QGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to "
"QGIS, and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired "
"outputs. The GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct "
"complex spatial analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we "
"needed to plan our field work and future prospection. Furthermore it "
"allowed us to import PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS."

"The choice for QGIS was also encouraged by the multi platform support. "
"The institution has three distinct facilities, and each of those "
"facilities has different systems \\---- we have Mac, Windows PC and Linux"
" PC, therefore it\\'s of extreme importance that we have the freedom to "
"install the software on any machine we want so we don\\'t get stuck to a "

"The overall experience with QGIS can only be rated has being very good "
"and recommendable. From our point of view, the main advantage of QGIS is "
"that it\\'s not just a GIS software --\\-- it\\'s a productivity suite "
"for spatial data. It allowed us to take advantage of other powerful tools"
" within a single work environment. From QGIS you can work with GRASS, "
"with PostGIS, with GPS data, with webservices and with tens of useful "
"plug-ins developed by users worldwide. The user friendly interface is "
"also a big advantage, especially if you have to train first time users "
"has we\\'ve done. The easyness of the interface makes production of maps "
"an everyday task and brought people closer to spatial approaches \\[3\\]."
