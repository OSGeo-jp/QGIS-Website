"The Missouri Herpetological Atlas Project (MOHAP) was initiated in 1997 "
"as a result of the desire to obtain and easily update detailed "
"distribution maps for Missouri (United States of America) amphibians and "
"reptiles. A database was established to store all valid localities, "
"including records published in historical literature sources and "
"specimens vouchered from museums. From the database, a series of maps can"
" be produced representing both locality records and \\\"county "
"records\\\" for each species."

"MOHAP hosts a web site at <http://atlas.moherp.org/> that describes the "
"project in detail and displays a variety of static maps, all produced by "
"QGIS. An atlas, published as a downloadable PDF, is released periodically"
" as a gratis publication in the spirit of open access to scientific "
"research (Daniel, R.E. and B.S. Edmond. 2012. Atlas of Missouri "
"Amphibians and Reptiles for 2011. "
"\\<<http://atlas.moherp.org/pubs/atlas11.pdf>\\>). Published maps are "
"used by field biologists, land managers, and others to better understand "
"species\\' distributions in Missouri."

"As of February 2013, the MOHAP database contained 31,495 entries "
"representing the specimens housed in 34 museum collections and cited in "
"32 historical literature sources; 5,118 documented county records; 6,884 "
"unique localities; and 12,866 unique species / locality combinations. The"
" state\\'s herpetofauna consists of 113 species."

"The process of creating maps with QGIS starts with data stored in several"
" PostgreSQL tables, spatially-enabled with PostGIS. Because maps are "
"static and ultimately destined for either the web or a printed atlas, "
"they are generated automatically for each species using a custom QGIS "
"Python plugin (Figures 1,2)."

"The final species maps have a clean and professional appearance (Figure "
"3). To better understand species\\' distributions, a series of base maps "
"are also created and labelled (Figure 4). Because of the way styles are "
"managed within each data layer, the base map layers can also be "
"incorporated into a set of species maps with little extra effort."

"At the beginning of the MOHAP project, several commercial and proprietary"
" tools were used to store and process data and produce maps for "
"publication. Starting in 2007, we set about to move all aspects of the "
"project to open source software. QGIS, along with PHP, PostgreSQL, "
"PostGIS, Python, and ReportLab, forms the open source linchpin to MOHAP, "
"effectively allowing the project and all data to exist free of "
"proprietary software entanglements."

"QGIS contains native support for PostGIS and a Python plugin "
"architecture, which were essential in creating the automated map "
"generation and export. The extensive API documentation was used along "
"with the plugin developer cookbook to create exactly what we needed for "
"the automation. The community support is also very good and includes a "
"huge array of shared plugins built and ready to use."

"Although we use QGIS in a small and specific way, its capabilities and "
"extensibility using Python is more than sufficient to tackle larger and "
"more complex projects."
