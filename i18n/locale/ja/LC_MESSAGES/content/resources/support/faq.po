"If you are trying to download QGIS and nothing seems to happen, please "
"consult the download manager of your browser. It can usually be found as "
"an icon (based on arrow, stop-watch or pie-chart) at the top-right corner"
" of your browser window. Click on the icon to see the download progress "
"or cancel the download. The normal procedure with downloads in the "
"browser is such, that it first asks you where to save the file (with a "
"file browser dialogue) and then you have to wait until the download is "
"finished. Because QGIS install packages can be rather large, depending on"
" the operating system, you have to be patient. The download size can be "
"anywhere between several hundred megabytes to sometimes more than one "
"gigabyte (in case of MS Windows MSI packages). Depending on your download"
" speed and the QGIS server load, downloads can take from several minutes "
"up to several hours."

"This is a misconception that we hear from time to time, but it is not "
"true. Donating to QGIS is optional. After downloading QGIS, there is a "
"message appearing, reminding that you can optionally donate to QGIS. "
"However, you can press \"Close this message\" and continue downloading "
"without any problem. We want QGIS to be accessible to anyone, no matter "
"how your financial situation might be. If you are a first-time QGIS user,"
" we recommend that you download, install and test QGIS first and find out"
" if the software is useful for the tasks you want to solve. Only if you "
"like QGIS and it substantially helps with your business, tasks or "
"processes, you should think about donating towards QGIS or supporting it "
"as a sustaining member."
