"QGIS is a project that can be used in many contexts and has a rich set of"
" features. To provide this functionality, it relies on many components, "
"relying on a large base of external dependencies (e.g. GDAL, PROJ, Python"
" libraries, Qt, etc.). Security issues in QGIS can arise in various "
"scenarios, including, but not limited to, vulnerabilities in its "
"dependencies, issues within QGIS code itself, or through the misuse of "
"its Python bindings. Here are the main categories:"
