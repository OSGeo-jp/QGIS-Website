"One huge behind-the-scenes job we completed for QGIS 3.10 is a "
"refactoring of the provider infrastructure. Now, providers allow both "
"dynamic and static linking. This was a pre-requisite to be able to build "
"QGIS libraries on platforms that do not support dynamic linkage (iOS), "
"and allows for QGIS based tools like the Input data collection app to be "
"distributed for iOS based devices!"
