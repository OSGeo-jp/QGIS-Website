"This is the next release in our 4-monthly release series. It gives you "
"early access to the new features we have been working on and represents "
"the \\'cutting edge\\' of QGIS development. If you are working in a "
"production environment where you wish to be more conservative about "
"rolling out new features to your users, we also provide a Long Term "
"Release (LTR) version of QGIS. The current LTR is version 2.8.2 and is "
"available at [download.qgis.org](http://download.qgis.org). LTR releases "
"will be supported with backported bug fixes for one year, and will be in "
"permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will be added, only bug "
"fixes and trivial updates). The features provided in QGIS 2.10 \\'Pisa\\'"
" will be included in the next LTR release (slated for release in 2016), "
"so using this release provides you with an excellent opportunity to test "
"new features that will make their way into the next LTR."
