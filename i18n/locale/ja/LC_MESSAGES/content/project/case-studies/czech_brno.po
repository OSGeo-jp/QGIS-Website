"LEAG plays important role in academic research held in College of "
"Business and Hotel Management. The need of spatial modeling requires also"
" excellent software. The philosophy of minimum cost and maximum "
"efficiency led to choice of open source solutions. This step resulted in "
"using core open source SW such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape and QGIS. "
"QGIS does not stand alone — we use MapWindow, OpenJump, gvSIG, SAGA and "
"others. But QGIS plays the major role."

"With no cost and high efficiency the Laboratory on Experimental and "
"Applied Geography produces high-quality analysis, maps and "
"visualizations. Using QGIS large databases are being created and further "
"testing of new functions are being done. Finally, one of the highest "
"impact of using QGIS could be seen in education —— QGIS is the first "
"software, which is presented to students. During regular workshops "
"students learn how to legally work with QGIS and how to create their own "
"maps."
