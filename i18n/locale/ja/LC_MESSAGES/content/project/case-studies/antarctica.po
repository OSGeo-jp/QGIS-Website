"Quantarctica is a collection of Antarctic geographical datasets, such as "
"base maps, satellite imagery, glaciology and geophysics data from data "
"centres around the world, prepared for viewing in QGIS. The package is "
"developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for the research "
"community, for classrooms and for operational use in Antarctica — freely "
"available for non-commercial purposes."

"Quantarctica (QGIS + Antarctica) was first developed for in-house use at "
"the Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for our glaciologists. There was"
" a need for a low or no cost complete GIS with essential datasets — "
"ready-to-use, easy-to-use, functionality rich and with offline "
"capabilities. QGIS seemed to be a perfect choice of GIS for the collected"
" datasets."

"Quantarctica has been used to examine geographical data from continental "
"to local scales, for viewing scientific project data on top of base maps "
"or with other scientific datasets, and to prepare maps for publications "
"and proposals. Quantarctica has so far proven to be a great tool, and a "
"very good alternative and supplement to other software used by the "
"researchers. It has provided new opportunities for our researchers in "
"their daily work."

"Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years "
"ago, there has been many requests in the research community outside the "
"institute to share this product, and we started to develop a public and "
"improved version to replace the in-house version. Following Antarctic "
"field testing, and adding new relevant datasets, Quantarctica version 1.0"
" was finally completed and made available for download in July 2013."

"Quantarctica is to be all about community effort. With contributions we "
"aim to expand with data from other disciplines, such as oceanography, "
"atmospheric sciences, geology and biology, and hope and believe that this"
" tool can be useful for the Antarctic community — as a complete Antarctic"
" GIS package."
