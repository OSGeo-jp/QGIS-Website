"There will be democratic teaching in our schools or education communities"
" when we generalize the use of Open Source software. This demands not "
"only a change in people\\'s way of thinking (sometimes molded by "
"advertising), but also a sustainable management of expenses and, "
"indirectly, fighting against software piracy. These advantages which are "
"inherent to the philosophy of the Open Source software will be the model "
"to follow if we want a quality education without boundaries or "
"dependencies of any kind. From this perspective, class 35 of the 12th "
"grade belonging to the technological course of territory and environment "
"at Jaime Moniz Secondary School, uses QGIS to develop activities proposed"
" in Geographical Information Systems, Applied Information Systems and "
"during their training period. Within the range of options of free GIS, "
"there were three underlying reasons for the choice of Open Source "
"selection: the user friendly and intuitive approach, supported by online "
"information provided by forums; the several software plug-ins and the "
"quality of the product in its final stage. (One should bear in mind that "
"these academic works were done by students who belong to a very young age"
" group.)"

"Expectation was the most dominating feeling in the firth lessons! The "
"group of students had only a theoretical and somewhat vague knowledge "
"about the issue of GIS. It was, therefore, necessary to link practical "
"activities to that theoretical knowledge - at first, through the "
"gathering of geographical information by using a support map, within the "
"school\\'s perimeter, and later, by using a GPS, concerning the area "
"surrounding the school. In figures 1 and 2 it is possible to view some of"
" the activities developed in class."

"Generally speaking, QGIS allured the students: \"to accomplish basic "
"functions of GIS through exercise associations of graphic and non-graphic"
" elements\"; \"to upload alphanumeric data\"; \"use functions of spacial "
"analysis\"; \"to make thematic maps\"; \"to make a Digital Elevation "
"Model\" and, last but not least, \"to recognize the relevance of a free "
"GIS for the analysis of geographical information, as well for the "
"sustainable management of the territory\". These theoretical and "
"practical purposes are achieved together along with other goals, "
"extremely important in the education context, such as: \"creating a "
"diversified educational experience\"; \"being in contact with local "
"reality\" and \"developing a constructive, positive and critical mind\"."

"In a flashback analysis of the whole process, I feel that the idea of "
"using QGIS, as a tool, to accomplish some teaching purposes, was an "
"excellent choice. At first, its use involved a lot of expectation. I had "
"never used GIS before and, therefore, I was learning and teaching at the "
"same time. The fact that the GIS turned out to be extremely user friendly"
" together, with the information available online, was a blessing for me. "
"Moreover, the school did not have to pay for another software license nor"
" it was dependent on license renewals, which substantially improved the "
"teaching quality, without any extra expenses. At present, students use "
"QGIS almost on their own to accomplish their different work plans. I hope"
" the final result shows the amount of effort involved in the whole "
"learning process."
