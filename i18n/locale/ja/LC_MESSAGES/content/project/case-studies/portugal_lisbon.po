"HABEaS —— Hotspot Areas for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is an "

"Superior de Agronomia](http://www.isa.utl.pt/home/), Technical University"

"The main goal of this platform is to provide free access to a wide "
"variety of data on biodiversity and ecosystem services for the "
"Mediterranean Basin that was scattered across a number of public and "
"private entities. Presently HABEaS WebGIS covers the south of Portugal, "
"but by the end of 2012/early 2013 it will be expanded to the north of "
"Portugal and also to the Tuzla Canton in Bosnia & Herzegovina. In the "
"long run we want to expand this tool to the entire Mediterranean Basin."

"Since the main goal of this tool is to promote free and easy access to "
"information on biodiversity and ecosystem services we decided to use only"
" free and open source software, that any person or entity can use "
"regardless of their location or financial constraints. The website where "
"HABEaS WebGIS is hosted on a server that runs Debian Linux and was "
"developed with Drupal CMS. PostgreSQL/PostGIS was used to store the data "
"and QGIS was used to process and analyze the GIS that we obtained from "
"several entities. We used both QGIS\\'s native tools but also GRASS GIS "
"and SAGA GIS tools through the GRASS plugin and SEXTANTE Toolbox."

"The geographic information contained in HABEaS has also been used by WWF "

"To determine which conservation values occure in each property we used "
"SEXTANTE Modeller to create a script that intersects all HABEaS layers "
"with the boundaries of the property. Using the same tool we were also "
"able to create a script that automatically calculates the amount of "
"carbon that is currently stored in each property."

"QGIS is easy to use and has very powerful geoprocessing capabilities. The"
" integration of GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS tools through SEXTANTE Toolbox "
"allowed us to perform a number of complex spatial analyzes and to "
"pipeline them using SEXTANTE Modeler. It was also very easy to produce "
"high quality maps with the new Print Composer and to export them in SVG "
"format for further editing with Inkscape which is a powerful open source "
"vector graphics editor."

"In general, our experience with QGIS has been very positive, the software"
" runs smoothly and the community is very active and supportive. Reported "
"bugs are usually resolved shortly after being reported by users and QGIS "
"developers are always willing to listen to \"end user\\'s\" needs and "
"suggestions."
