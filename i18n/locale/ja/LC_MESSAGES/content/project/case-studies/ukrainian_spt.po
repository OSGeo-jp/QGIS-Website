"Formed in 2018, Julie\\'s Data is a Ukrainian consulting agency "
"delivering open-source solutions to broad public use. We focus mainly on "
"strategic environmental assessment with GIS, urban planning, creating and"
" teaching QGIS courses, and running the crowdsourcing project described "

"Working with local communities for the past few years, Julie\\'s Data "
"formed the concept of solving a particular array of public administration"
" problems dictated by the lack of modern geodata management tools. One "
"such problem - is the lack of high-quality, accessible, and legal local "
"geospatial data from cadasters which enables communities to appear on the"
" world investment map and allows them to form a healthy competition of "
"proposals for sustainable development."

"Following its open source attitude, at the beginning of June, Julie\\'s "
"Data (<https://juliesdata.com/>) launched a crowdsourcing initiative "
"aimed to implement the above mentioned structure with open source tools "
"and called to join everyone to the development of GIS-applied tools for "
"spatial planning using QGIS."

"As a result, a group of 62 participants of various specialties was formed"
" - architects, geodesists, surveyors, cartographers, GIS specialists, "
"ecologists, scientists, representatives of local government, and others. "
"The participants set a goal to create high-quality spatial planning tools"
" (SPT for convenience) based on the approved geodatabase structure so "
"that every interested person can use them freely and without unnecessary "
"operational costs for solving their tasks - in professional urban "
"planning, scientific, educational, or public activity. Therefore, it was "
"decided to distribute future SPT under the terms of the CC BY-SA license."

"For the SPT implementation, QGIS was chosen, as it satisfies the two main"
" requirements of the participants: firstly - to ensure each participant "
"has the opportunity to join the work without obstacles, and the second - "
"to give everyone the ability to use the developed SPT without unnecessary"
" barriers and costs. Most of the participants got acquainted with QGIS "
"for the first time during the project and began to use QGIS in their "
"professional work."

"The working group successfully implemented the database in PostgreSQL and"
" GeoPackage formats and created forms for the classes (layers), including"
" the rules for data integrity approved by requirements for the geospatial"
" database, which were set up in QGIS. The symbol library with the rule-"
"based symbology for each class (layers) was set up in the .qgs project "
"file. Layer style settings for each layer were tested and saved into the "
"geospatial database of the SPT."

"We understand that for the broad implementation of GIS into governance, "
"Ukraine needs a solid open-source community. So, among other "

"Our initiative continues its life and we invite everyone who wants to "
"join it. The most important questions for the next stage are "
"relationships between classes of the geospatial database, tools for "
"topology rules verification, which are required by law, and also to "
"develop a minimum set of SPT functionality for effective work with "
"spatial documentation for local communities."
