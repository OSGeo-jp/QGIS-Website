"In our region, Argentinean Patagonia, we have very few references about "
"the application of GIS in High School for the construction of "
"geographical knowledge as a mean to face territorial and environmental "
"issues. The case of the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town "
"analyzed by QGIS, tends to demonstrate a methodology of an academic "
"exercise that can project, with important reaches, as formative instances"
" related to the geographical reasoning in students of 12th grade of the "
"Abraham Lincoln School."

"We started by the observation (inventory), digitizing the cadastral "
"blocks and the green areas (tree´s canopy) using Google Earth satellite "
"images. As a conceptual framework, we lectured about cartographic design,"
" satellite images reading and interpretation, and specially, location "
"analysis to contrast the situation (in m^2^) of the urban green spaces by"
" inhabitant in Rada Villa coastal town, with values suggested by the "
"World Health Organization, WHO (a minimum of 9 m^2^ of green areas, by "
"person, in urban areas)."

"Based in the projection of an average value of 4 inhabitants by cadastral"
" plot, we estimated that the current (2010) urban population Rada Tilly "
"would go up to around 9.600 inhabitants. These people reside in 209 "
"blocks and they represent 157.6 hectares. The average population density "
"would be of 61 inhabitants by hectare."

"The total inventoried green areas grow up to 150.736 m^2^ (15 hectares). "
"Reason why we can consider that the green area by inhabitant in the study"
" area is 15.7 m^2^ (the WHO suggested value is 9 m^2^ of green area by "
"inhabitant). This value proves a very favorable situation, as far as the "
"environmental benefits, that trees offer to the inhabitants in this "
"marine coastal town."

"Although the project was an academic exercise of High School, we deeply "
"value the inventory´s results obtained by QGIS. Students worked with all "
"academic rigor and seriousness, showing appropriation of the thematic "
"(urban green spaces) and also of the tool (QGIS). It was a very enriching"
" experience for them and also for the educational staff involved."

"After the project experience we can assure that the FOSS QGIS is an "
"extremely recommendable alternative for capture, processing, storage, "
"analysis, recovery and updating of spatial data, in fast and efficient "
"form. We have such a positive impression of the software that we will "
"start the use of QGIS in our university courses, replacing GIS "
"Proprietary software that we have being using."
