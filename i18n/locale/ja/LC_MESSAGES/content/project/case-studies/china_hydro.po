"I work for a urban planning company in China. It is often difficult to "
"design proper environmental protection because the common sources of data"
" may be a state secret or may not even exist. Frequently, we are asked to"
" do designs without proper survey data. In addition there is usually not "
"enough time for a proper study. My background is in Urban Planning with a"
" minor in Environmental Science."

"The task was plan a conservation park on the Chinese side of the Ili "
"River which supplies 80% of the water to Lake Balkhash. FOSS GIS "
"application + FOSS GIS data stores + FOSS GIS education were all critical"
" to reconstruct and model the Hydrological and Ecological processes "
"necessary for authentic conservation planning. As a non-scientist with no"
" prior training or experience I could not have done it without all three."
" My company did not and would not pay to purchase GIS software to run the"
" industry standard arcHYDRO."

"With some trial and error I was able to produce an arcHYDRO like output "
"from QGIS. Beginning with a USGS Hydrosheds DEM which was converted into "
"a Regularized Spline with Tension using the GRASS functions inside QGIS "
"and training by Helena Mitsova. The RST surface was analyzed this surface"
" to find the catchments and flow paths, and resulting vector topologies "
"were cleaned up in QGIS to generate the Hydrologic network and also to "
"build up the attribute tables."

"This network was ranked by r.stream extension in GRASS to build Hortons "
"and Hacks stream ordering. Then a distance to outlet surface grid was "
"generated and analyzed by zonal statistics to find the farthest point. "
"Next, r.drain in GRASS to trace a time of concentration line. Finally "
"v.net in GRASS was used to build a network of pour points, flow paths, "
"TOC paths, and HMDP for each watershed. In this workflow, the QGIS tool "
"attribute by location was invaluable."

"After the basic hydrologic network was finished I used UN FAO soils "
"database with table joins to classify soils. Then using query functions "
"in QGIS the FAO soils were converted to USDA soils. A previously "
"downloaded USGS ETM7+ grid was classified with the i.cluser and r.maxlik "
"in GRASS into a NLCD grid. By using reclassification tables I converted "
"the landcover to Manning\\'s n-value grid for overland flow. Finally I "
"wrote a lookup table in r.mapcalc and merged the soil and landcover grids"
" into and NRCS TR-55 curve numbers following the arcHYDRO methodology."

"To create the rainfall grids I performed statistical analysis on GHCN "
"tables to find rainfall depths for design storms of 1,2,5,10,50,100 year "
"returns. Then I downloaded a free sample grid of PRISM for China and "
"assuming a linear relationship, converted average cell values to maximum "
"cell values in order to build maximum rainfall intensity grids."

"I began using QGIS out of desperation for lack of arcMAP but now I never "
"want to go back. The investment of time in FOSS is worthwhile because you"
" can take it with you to any job. The combination of GRASS QGIS PostGIS "
"gives you the full functionality of expensive GIS systems. The online "
"learning resources provided were as valuable as the actual software. I "
"was able to learn QGIS fast enough to produce a great project in a fast "
"based real world industry environment."
