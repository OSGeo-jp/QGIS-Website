"Within the years, the institution has gathered loads of information in "
"several formats such as SHP, DWG, DXF, GeoTIFF and ECW, among others. So,"
" what we wanted was to have all this information available, organized and"
" in a common format with the purpose of being able to provide and display"

"I decided to use Mapserver and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension to be "
"able to deliver our satellite imagery, orthopothos, digital elevation "
"models and vector information with Web Map Services, thinking that any "
"application will consume our services. But the problem was that many of "
"the commercial and free applications don't work with OGC standards, "
"specially with WFS. After exploring many geographic information systems, "
"I realized that QGIS was the only one which can connect to WMS, WCS and "
"WFS successfully."

"Internally, we use QGIS to check the raster and vector data of the "
"agencies before publishing it, and after its integration, we used it "
"again to test the Web services that we've created. Also, we have done "
"many spatial analysis with QGIS pulling the data directly from our "
"PostgreSQL spatial database, then, we export the results as shape files."

"This project understood as the technological component of a Spatial Data "
