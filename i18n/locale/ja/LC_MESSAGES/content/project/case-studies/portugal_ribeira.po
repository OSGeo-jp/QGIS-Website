"The Iberian wolf is a sub-species of the gray wolf that exists only in "
"north of Portugal and Spain, with small isolated groups in the south of "
"Douro river. During the last century, it suffered a high regression, "
"being a \"vulnerable\" species in Spain and \"endangered\" in Portugal. "
"Nowadays, there are only around 300 wolves in Portugal, due to the high "
"persecution, destruction and fragmentation of the habitat."

"Ribeira de Pena is a municipality in the Vila Real district in the north "
"of Portugal. It is a rural municipality, characterized by agriculture, "
"grazing livestock, forest, mountains, valleys and diverse fauna, along "
"with low human density, that provides shelter and food for wolves. "
"Located in a zone of transition between the harsh and mountainous Trás-"
"os-Montes and the verdant Minho, Ribeira de Pena is one of the "
"municipalities that can work like an ecological corridor between areas "
"with higher wolf concentration in the north with lower concentration in "
"the south."

"Meanwhile, I entered in the new world of Linux. After that I was "
"contacted to help some researchers to model ecological corridors for "
"wolves in Ribeira de Pena, using GIS, since they never worked with this "
"kind of software. Because I was already using Linux instead of windows, "
"my first problem was which software to use. Then I heard about QGIS and "
"decided to give it a try, although it seemed very simplistic and "
"incomplete, when compared to what I already knew. I quickly realized how "
"mistaken I was, and got really enthusiastic with the analytical "
"capabilities QGIS provided, specially with GRASS integration."

"To model the ecological corridors, we used the QGIS along with the GRASS "
"plugin. We used several geographic information along with presence data "
"of the species to model the ecological corridors. Here are some of the "

"With this work we obtained a map with the potential ecological corridors "
"for wolf in Ribeira de Pena municipality. These are areas to be "
"considered by the city council technicians when planning conservation "
"measures for the species. These corridors are of extreme importance "
"because they can connect the fragile wolf packs in Vila Real in the south"
" with those in the north, which are continuous with those from Peneda-"
"Gerês and Spain far more stable. It is from particular importance those "
"corridors that cross human settlements, like small villages, cities and "
"roads. These areas must be considered critical for wolf conservation, and"
" applied measures to reduce human impact in this species."

"Both QGIS and plugin GRASS are very intuitive with user-friendly "
"interface, with all essential functions to perform most analysis. For "
"what I could see, QGIS and GRASS perform equally as well as the "
"proprietary programs I was most familiar with from college days, with the"
" big advantage of free open-source software, usable in every computer or "
"notebook without licenses, constant upgrades and the ultimate advantage "
"to contribute to it\\'s improvement and/or tip the developers about some "
"essential function."

"Changing to Linux and then to QGIS and GRASS was one of my best calls, "
"and although there can be some missing issues, easily resolved in the "
"future with the developers, I don\\'t regret my decision and advise "
"everyone to use them."
