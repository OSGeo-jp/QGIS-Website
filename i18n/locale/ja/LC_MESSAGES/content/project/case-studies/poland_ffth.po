msgid ""
"Over the past few years many EU countries have launched operational "
"programs to implement European Digital Agenda (EAC) developed by the "
"European Commission in 2010. According to its guidelines until 2020 every"
" citizen of the European Union should have access to 30 Mbps Internet "
"bandwidth and at least half of them will have access to bandwidth not "
"slower than 100 Mbps."

msgid ""
"Poland is one of the countries in which the Agenda is being implemented. "
"Thanks to European Union funds many local operators can compete with "
"large telecom providers as regards high-speed broadband services. "
"Unfortunately, applying for funding requires a great deal of work "
"necessary to draw up proper documentation, including, among other things,"
" development of planned FTTH (Fiber To The Home) network conceptual maps."

"Moreover, currently there are no GIS-based IT tools available to support "
"the potential beneficiaries with the preparation of documentation. The "
"complexity of the problem is even more complicated by the fact that such "
"a software should enable a creation of documentation in accordance with "
"specific program guidelines (e.g. the obligation to connect educational "
"institutions)."
