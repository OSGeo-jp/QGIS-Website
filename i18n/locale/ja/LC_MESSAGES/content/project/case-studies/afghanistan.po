"The Danish Demining Group (DDG), the specialised mine action unit of the "
"Danish Refugee Council, has been working in Afghanistan since 1999, "
"undertaking humanitarian mineclearance, unexploded ordnance (UXO) "
"disposal and mine risk education. DDG Afghanistan delivers humanitarian "
"mine action to save life, strengthen the sense of safety through risk "
"education and help remove obstacles to the productive use of resources, "
"helping to realise Afghanistan's development potential. Since the start "
"of operations in Afghanistan, DDG has removed over 24,000 landmines and "
"over 940,000 pieces of UXO. Currently, DDG is working in the northern "
"provinces of Balkh and Samangan, and the central provinces of Kabul, "
"Parwan and Panjshir."

"In Afghanistan, mineclearance activities are coordinated through the Mine"
" Action Coordination Centre for Afghanistan (MACCA), who collect and "
"disseminate geospatial information on known hazards (minefields, "
"battlefields, 'spot' UXO tasks), and update this information as clearance"
" progresses. New shapefiles of these 'hazard polygons' are issued by the "
"MACCA on a regular basis, and mineclearance organisations can use these "
"to assess the situation of mineclearance in their areas of operation. DDG"
" is trialling the use of QGIS within the organization to replace the "
"expensive commercial softwares it has used in the past."

"The use of geospatial data is most useful in the planning and survey "
"phases. In Afghanistan, security problems and rugged terrain mean that "
"physical re-survey of known sites is not always easy. Instead, the use of"
" a mixture of data — satellite or aerial photography underlays, digitized"
" Soviet-era topographic maps, hazard shapefiles and digital elevation "
"models — allow DDG to get an idea of the location of a minefield in "
"relation to the terrain and surrounding natural and physical features "
"before sending in a survey team. QGIS plugins add useful capabilities, "
"like the ability to visualise terrain in 3D. The attached screenshot "
"above — made using the plugin Qgis2threejs —— shows an area just south of"
" the Darulaman Palace in Kabul, with active minefields (along the "
"ridgelines on the left) shown in red over a Soviet topographic raster "
"layer combined with SRTM data. Minefields already cleared show as light "
"green."

"Kabul University's campus is still contaminated with suspected hazardous "
"areas — thought to comprise of air-dropped bombs or similar ordnance. "
"While not posing any immediate threat to students or staff, these hazards"
" will require eventual clearance to allow future construction within an "
"educational institution vital to Afghanistan's future development. The "
"hazards are also notable as among the last significant remaining "
"hazardous areas in the Kabul metropolitan area. By using QGIS to combine "
"the hazard polygons from earlier surveys with highly accurate aerial "
"photography provided by the USGS, discrepancies can be noted — e.g. where"
" the polygons do not match the shape of the buildings, as evident in the "
"northwest part of the campus —— which can direct survey teams to places "
"to first conduct a more accurate re-survey."

"QGIS also syncs well with data collected from field operations using "
"handheld Garmin GPS, allowing clearance maps to be made with the "
"locations of mines found and destroyed."

"The use of QGIS, along with a renewed interest in data analysis, has "
"spurred new ways of looking at the data available, and combining it with "
"other data sources to better target mineclearance activities. It is also "
"driving improved mapping capabilities within the organisation, and an "
"ability to better communicate the impact of its work to international "
"donors. In a part of the world where 'formal' GIS training is difficult "
"to acquire, the collaborative nature of the QGIS user community is "
"greatly appreciated, as technical problems can often be solved by "
"consulting online forums. In short, QGIS is playing a role in working "
"towards ridding Afghanistan of landmines and UXO."
