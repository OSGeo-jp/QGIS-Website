"Amurum forest reserve is located near the city of Jos, Plateau state, "
"Nigeria. It was established in conjunction with the initiation of the "
"A.P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute (APLORI) for the purpose "
"of natural conservation, education and research. APLORI is hosted by the "
"Department of Zoology at the University of Jos. Yearly a group of "
"approximately eight highly motivated students from all over Nigeria "
"obtain training in conservation biology, statistics (with R) and as of "
"2011 GIS as well. During two weeks in December 2011 we studied basic GIS "
"concepts and applied those with QGIS for various conservation purposes. "
"In this article we describe the way in which we used QGIS to map the "
"habitats and its determinants of Amurum reserve and how the basic habitat"
" maps were used to obtain strata for the purpose of efficiently "
"determining the spatial distribution of the avifauna including the "
"biodiversity."

"The GdalTools were used to merge original data sets and to clip a smaller"

"locations in the reserve."

"Overall, the elevations of the SRTM data set corresponded well to the "
"gps-collected elevations. Terrain models in GdalTools were used to "
"calculate hills hades and slopes for the area. These variables are "
"important from an ecological point of view because they are strongly "
"associated with the type of habitat."

"Since we intended to develop a good-looking map, we interpolated the "
"original (clipped) elevation map to obtain a higher resolution map. We "
"used the warp tool in GdalTools. By means of the contour tool we obtained"

"Coordinates of the boundary of the reserve were obtained by walking along"
" the boundaries of the reserve with a GPS. The waypoints and tracks "
"stored in the GPS were smoothly imported using the GPS Tools. The "
"imported waypoints and tracks were used to construct a polygon shapefile."
" The tracks inside the reserve were mapped in a similar fashion."

"We were able to quickly and precisely construct a habitat map of Amurum "
"using a Google satellite image which we got into the workspace with the "
"Openlayers plugin. The reserve has three types of distinct habitat: "
"Savannah, Gallery forest and Rocky outcrop. On the basis of the satellite"
" image we used the editor to draw polygons demarcating the three "
"habitats. Setting the snapping options correctly allowed the construction"
" of non-overlapping polygons."

"The random points in fTools were used for this purpose. All the locations"
" were visited during two mornings by four groups of students (2 per "
"group) giving a total of 38 random locations dispersed throughout the "
"reserve. The observation data were entered in a spreadsheet and analyzed "
"using R. In addition, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated "
"using R. After merging the location file with the resulting observation "
"data it was exported as a csv file which was loaded into QGIS using the "
"\"Add delimited text layer\" tool. On the basis of the above mentioned "
"layers a map was constructed presenting some of the most important "
"landscape features and avian diversity of the Amurum reserve."

"Overall, the course was a great success. We - a group of students with no"
" previous GIS experience —— enjoyed working with QGIS a lot. Within just "
"two weeks time we were able to develop an extremely useful map of the "
"reserve. Amongst others, the extents of the various habitats were "
"determined which allows for stratification and thus for better estimates "
"of abundances of various kinds of organisms. Basically we are now able to"
" do better ecological research using QGIS as an open source platform."
