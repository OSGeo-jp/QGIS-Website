"**Steven**: We are a multi-disciplinary department so I don't have a "

"less complicated interactives (e.g. [Inside Isis Inc: The journey of a "
"barrel of oil](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/isis-oil/)). I also produce "
"the standard news related charts and maps on a daily basis. Over the past"
" two years I have been concentrating on developing our cartographic "
"offerings at the FT. QGIS has been instrumental in changing how we "
"produce maps, and in conjunction with other tools such Blender have "
"helped me to be more creative with how we approach maps."
