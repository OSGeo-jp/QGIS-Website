"Snowy Hydro Limited (SHL) is a peak electricity generator based in the Snowy"
" Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Despite owning a variety of "
"generation assets across the country, Snowy Hydro Limited is best known for "
"the custodianship of an iconic piece of Australian infrastructure, the Snowy"
" Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme."

"The Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme, is made possible by seasonal snow"
" falls in the New South Wales alpine region. Water from the spring snow melt"
" is used to generate electricity addressing peak demand in the national "
"electricity market, while also diverting water to the drier inland areas of "
"South Eastern Australia for irrigation and agriculture."

msgid ""
"Each year during the winter months (1st June to the 31st October) SHL "
"obtains as many cloud free images as possible from the MODIS Terra (EOS AM) "
"satellite. These images are then ingested into an algorithm known as the "
"Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI), which is used to indicate areas "
"where snow is present. While this algorithm is not unique to any one "
"particular sensor, the MODIS instrument was chosen due to its adequate "
"spatial resolution and daily coverage of the project area (Map 1.1 Snowy "
"Water Catchment)."

"The aim of this project is to automate the NDSI workflow as a model in the "
"QGIS processing toolbox. The required output is a vector polygon showing the"
" snow covered extent within the Snowy Water Catchment, along with "
"attribution describing the total area covered in square kilometres."

"The NDSI algorithm itself is quite simple (show below in Formula 1.1 - "
"Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI)) and the subsequent steps required "
"to extract snow cover in a vector format also lends itself nicely to a "
"processing toolbox model."

"This NDSI algorithm will return results between -1 and 1, with the threshold"
" for snow typically being values greater than 0.4. An example of the NDSI "
"output is shown below (Map 1.3 - NDSI output), alongside a natural colour "
"image (Map 1.2 - MODIS true colour) for the 13th July 2014. As seen from "
"these images the NDSI output is very good at discriminating snow covered "
"areas from other land cover types and clouds. It can however misclassify "
"portions of large water bodies as snow, caused by water having absorption "
"characteristics in the Near Infrared part of the spectrum. This "
"characteristic of the NDSI indicates the need to incorporate a water mask at"
" some stage in the model."

"The NDSI output is created with some very simple band map by using the GRASS"

"The QGIS processing toolbox is a powerful way to automate a workflow such as"
" this snow classification. The model shown above successfully automates the "
"snow classification process, and delivers a GIS dataset that can be used for"
" visualisation and input into further statistical applications. It "
"successfully removes subjective user error associated with previous methods "
"used by SHL, while providing a repeatable and consistent classification "
"tool. Some seasonal results can be viewed here."
