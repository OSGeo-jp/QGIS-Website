"Montecchio Maggiore is a small town in the middle west of Vicenza (about "
"24.000 population). And as many other italian municipality it manages the "
"town planning; in particular the urban planning and what we call \"recovery "
"plan\" aka PDR —— Piani Di Recupero. This urbanistic tool is dedicated to "
"the historical area in the center of the town and it requires a specific "
"study: building state of conservation, intended use, particular historical "
"notice via survey and restitution to produce planimetric and prospectus "
"graphics. For this purpose it has used QGIS in addition to "
"Postgresql/Postgis database, PHP code and Libreoffice suite, QCAD "
"(LibreCAD)."

"Every building data was retrieved via survey and written in paper schedule. "
"Once in office the data were inputed into the Postgresql/Postgis database "
"via PHP form using canonical web browser (Firefox, Iceweasel as well). In a "
"second moment the shape of every building was draw with QGIS and linked to "
"the survey table via id key field (PostgreSQL/Postgis view)."

"Thus a photo was linked to every building facilitating the design and "
"analisys in the gis project (using the \"action\" feature). The SQL tools "
"(pgquery, postgis manager, dbmanager et al.) allowed to obtain very "
"sophisticated query immediately viewable in the map canvas such as: volume "
"calculation split by building intended use, standards area calculation in "
"percentage of the total planning area and other minor queries. All useful "
"items for the design and planning study otherwise not possible without a "
"very strength tool like gis (and QGIS in particular)."

"The strength of QGIS is the very user friendly interface coupled with the "
"several tools it offers. The connection with vary data formats (shape files,"
" spatialite db, postgresql/postgis db,\\...) facilitates and increases the "
"interoperability between different worlds. And thus the freedom offered by "
"the free software (QGIS, PHP, Libreoffice, QCAD) stimulates and open new "
"horizons."
