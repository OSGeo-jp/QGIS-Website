"Working in southern Tanzania, the Udzungwa Elephant Project (UEP) is using "
"QGIS for its training in wildlife research and conservation. In February "
"2012, it held a two-day workshop for the Ecology and Protection (anti-"
"poaching) staff of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, along with members "
"of the Udzungwa Ecological Monitoring Centre."

"Trainees used their own laptops and were provided with the installer for "
"QGIS 1.7.3 along with key data layers covering the National Park: protected "
"area boundaries, scanned topographic maps, a DEM, roads, ranger posts, and "
"habitat types."

"By the end of the two days, everyone was able to add GPS download data, "
"create and edit new layers, save map projects, design print composers, and "
"save graphics files for inclusion in reports and presentations —— this last "
"feature is specially useful in using GIS to help in normal workflows. Even "
"during the course, National Park staff were using the GIS to view the GPS "
"locations of new-reported elephant carcass locations —— the result of "
"poaching —— and to start planning responses."

"QGIS offered us several attractions: not only is it completely free, but its"
" open source nature makes it responsive to particular development needs; it "
"runs well on older computers and has a relatively small installer; and in "
"general we have found it user-friendly for newcomers to GIS."

"The Udzungwa Elephant Project is based next to Tanzania\\'s Udzungwa "
"Mountains National Park, a range of evergreen forested mountains reaching "
"over 2,500 metres. It studies the ecology of elephants in and around the "
"mountains, with the aim of understanding how elephants move between "
"different Tanzanian parks and reserves, and how such corridors might be "
"maintained while reducing crop damage caused by elephants. More widely, "
"elephants are a \\\"flagship species\\\" for the conservation of the "
"incredible wildlife and landscapes of southern Tanzania."
