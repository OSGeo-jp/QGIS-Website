"The Associação Leonel Trindade -- Sociedade de História Natural (ALT-SHN) is"
" a non profit institution headquarted in Torres Vedras, Portugal, "
"specialized in paleontology. The institution manages a large fossil "
"collection, mainly from Upper Jurassic. One of the key issues in "
"paleontological management is to assess spatial context of the sites from "
"where the fossils are retrieved -- hundreds of sites representing thousands "
"of different specimens."

"Back in 2008, we came up with the idea of exploring GIS technologies to "
"support the investigation and get a more holistic perspective on the "
"heritage we were dealing. This idea boosted SIGAP Project (GIS applied to "
"paleontology) \\[2\\]. The project, supported by public and private entities"
" -- mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army\\'s Geographic "
"Institute (IGeoE), aimed three goals:"

"QGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to QGIS,"
" and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired outputs. "
"The GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct complex spatial "
"analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we needed to plan our "
"field work and future prospection. Furthermore it allowed us to import "
"PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS."

"The choice for QGIS was also encouraged by the multi platform support. The "
"institution has three distinct facilities, and each of those facilities has "
"different systems — we have Mac, Windows PC and Linux PC, therefore it\\'s "
"of extreme importance that we have the freedom to install the software on "
"any machine we want so we don\\'t get stuck to a particular computer."

"The overall experience with QGIS can only be rated has being very good and "
"recommendable. From our point of view, the main advantage of QGIS is that "
"it\\'s not just a GIS software — it\\'s a productivity suite for spatial "
"data. It allowed us to take advantage of other powerful tools within a "
"single work environment. From QGIS you can work with GRASS, with PostGIS, "
"with GPS data, with webservices and with tens of useful plug-ins developed "
"by users worldwide. The user friendly interface is also a big advantage, "
"especially if you have to train first time users has we\\'ve done. The "
"easyness of the interface makes production of maps an everyday task and "
"brought people closer to spatial approaches \\[3\\]."
