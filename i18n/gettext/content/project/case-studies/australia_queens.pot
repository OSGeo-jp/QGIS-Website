"The Southern Downs Regional Council (SDRC) is a small-to-medium sized local "
"government in south east Queensland, Australia. The council region, mainly "
"the southern part, suffers from major bushfires. Bushfire is a real and "
"present concern for the residents and landowners in the Southern Downs "
"Region, and has resulted in the loss of life and property."

"As bushfire is not only a problem for SDRC but also for the whole of "
"Queensland, the state government requires that each local government "
"identifies the bushfire hazard in their area via the State Planning Policy "
"1/03 Mitigating the Adverse Impacts of Flood, Bushfire and Landslide "
"\\[1\\]. This kind of job would normally be done using consultants but was "
"instead done by the council itself using a combination of QGIS and GRASS."

"QGIS, using the GRASS plugin, was selected as it provided the tools needed "
"to complete the job and the interaction between QGIS and GRASS made it easy "
"to process the raster maps and present them in a meaningful way to users. "
"SDRC uses MapInfo for its main GIS system, however MapInfo's addons were not"
" as powerful as GRASS GIS for raster processing."

"The QGIS GRASS plugin was used to import 5 meter contours of the whole "
"region into GRASS which were then converted into a contour raster map using "
"r.surf.contour. A slope and aspect map were then generated using "
"r.slope.aspect from the raster contour map. Categories were assigned to "
"different slope and aspect ranges and given a hazard risk sore. Vegetation "
"areas were also given different risk scores. All the resulting raster maps "
"were then combined using mapcalc and given a final risk hazard score. The "
"risk scores are then divided into three main categories: high; medium; and "
"low."

"As all GRASS commands can be run from the command line, all the commands "

msgid ""
"Overall QGIS, together with the GRASS plugin, provided a great experience "
"and a great final outcome for the council doing their own bushfire hazard "
"mapping. The GRASS plugin provides a very easy to use interface to GRASS "
"through QGIS. As QGIS is able to open the GRASS raster format natively, "
"integration is very seamless and maps can be made with ease."
