"Another awesome release in the trail of great QGIS releases we have made "
"across 18 years of development. This release is so jam-packed with new "
"features and improvements big and small, it is hard to know where to start. "
"Some of the marquee features include vector tile support, huge advances in "
"mdal / mesh support, native support for temporal data in WMS-T, PG Raster, "
"vector providers, and mesh layers. Users focussed on cartography and "
"digitising haven\\'t been left out either, with many new options for you!"

"magically turned into native backend queries, BUUUUUUUUUUUT\\... because we "
"lack QGIS expression support for DateTime literals, we currently rely on the"
" \\\"to_datetime\\\" expression function and coerce everything through "
"strings. None of the expression compilers handle this function, so currently"
" \\*all\\* filtering is done on the QGIS side. We need to add functions for "
