"In Memorium: This release is named \\'Tisler\\' after a small Norwegian "
"island that was a favourite visiting place of Håvard Tveite who passed away "
"in May 2021. Håvard was a very active member of the QGIS community, "
"providing valuable input to the documentation, developing numerous plugins, "
"and taking care of the QGIS Resources Sharing Repository to name just a few "
"of his contributions. The map on the QGIS 3.24 splash screen is an "
"orienteering map that Håvard has created. He liked spending some time each "
"year map-making at Tisler."
