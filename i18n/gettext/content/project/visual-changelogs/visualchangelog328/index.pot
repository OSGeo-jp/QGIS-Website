"QGIS 3.28 Firenze introduces various feature updates, UX modifications, "

"The splash screen features a rare and extraordinary 1847 map of Firenze, or "
"Florence, Italy by Giuseppe Molini. This magnificently engraved map was "
"originally drawn in 1731 by the Florentine architect Ferdinando Ruggieri. "
"Oriented to the south, the map covers the old walled center of Florence as "
"it extends on both sides of the Arno River. The upper right quadrant "
"features the lily symbol of Florence. Though printed in 1847, this map has "
"been prepared in the 17th-century style by copperplate engraving on thick-"
"laid paper. Firenze in 1847 was on the cusp of political transformation. One"
" year following the production of this rare map the Grand Duke of Tuscany, "
"responding to political demonstrations throughout Florence, granted Tuscany "
"its first constitution."
