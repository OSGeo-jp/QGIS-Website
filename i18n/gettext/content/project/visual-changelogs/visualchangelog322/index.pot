"Białowieża Forest is named after the village Białowieża, which is located "
"right in the middle of this woodland. It is one of the oldest settlements in"
" the area, nowadays hosting numerous research and tourism activities. Today,"
" there are three research institutions in the village: [Białowieża "
"Geobotanical Station, University of Warsaw](https://bsg.bialowieza.pl/en/), "
"[The Mammal Research Institute, Polish Academy of "

" carry out their studies, and as such, there are also other users of QGIS in"
" the area, as well as additional projects which contribute to the Open Data "
