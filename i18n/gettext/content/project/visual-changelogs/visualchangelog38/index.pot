"In previous QGIS versions, when a marker line was rendered using interval or"

"the exact line orientation at the position of the symbol. This often leads "
"to undesirable rendering effects, where little \\\"jaggies\\\" or corners in"

msgstr ""

#: content/project/visual-changelogs/visualchangelog38/index.md:102
msgid ""
"We want your maps to be as beautiful as possible, so in QGIS 3.8 the marker "
"angle is instead calculated by averaging the line over a specified distance "
"either side of the symbol. E.g. averaging the line angle over 4mm means we "
"take the points along the line 2mm from either side of the symbol placement,"
" and use these instead to calculate the line angle for that symbol. This has"
" the effect of smoothing (or removing!) any tiny local deviations from the "
"overall line direction, resulting in much nicer visual orientation of marker"
" or hash lines."
