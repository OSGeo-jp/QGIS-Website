"This is a special release since it is designated an \\'LTR\\' (Long Term "
"Release). LTR releases will be supported with backported bug fixes for **one"
" year**, and will be in permanent feature freeze (i.e. no new features will "
"be added, only bug fixes and trivial updates). Note that we are in "
"discussion to extend the term of our LTR releases to two years, but for "
"technical reasons we will not do this until QGIS 3.2."

"The purpose of LTR releases is to provide a stable and less frequently "

" with updating user skills, training materials etc. more than once per year."
" The success of the LTR is very much down to you, our beloved users - we "

"contracts with support providers specify that any bug fixes done on your "
"behalf are applied to the LTR branch as well as our normal development "

"[2.12](../visualchangelog212/) releases as this QGIS 2.14 includes all "
