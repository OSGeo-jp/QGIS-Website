"QGIS 3.20 Odense features a splash screen which displays a section of [the "

"Denmark's third largest city, [Odense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odense)"
" from 1593. The map was published by [Georg "
"Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Braun) (1541-1622) in the work "
"*Civitates orbis terrarum* (Cities of the World). Georg Braun's maps are all"
" beautiful and were, for the period, produced at a high cartographic level. "
"*Civitates orbis terrarum* was long the main source of maps of the world's "
"cities, such as "
"[Paris](http://www5.kb.dk/maps/kortsa/2012/jul/kortatlas/object62269/en/), "

"CRS systems and projection information. Amongst these improvements to CRS "
"management are the basic support for coordinate epoch of dynamic CRS systems"
" and advanced accuracy integrity warnings, placing QGIS 3.20 firmly at the "
