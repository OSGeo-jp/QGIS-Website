"The Federal Department of Town and Country Planning, Peninsular Malaysia "
"(JPBD) is a federal agency that advises matters on town and country "
"planning. The scope of administration for the department however is limited "
"to Peninsular Malaysia as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia have their "
"respective town planning agencies. Town and country planning is on the "
"concurrent list in the Federal Legislation, thus, at the federal level, JPBD"
" advises the Housing and Local Government Minister from which JPBD gets its "
"patronage as well as to advise the National Physical Planning Council "
"chaired by the Prime Minister. At the state level, the state director "
"advises the State Planning Committee chaired by the Chief Minister. At the "
"local level, JPBD advises local planning authorities on planning matters by "
"being involved in the preparation of mandatory development plans. At "
"Headquarters, the National Physical Plan Division prepares the National "
"Physical Plan while four regional project offices assist in the preparation "
"of State Structure Plans, District Local Plans and Special Area Plans. As "
"public agencies were traditionally established base on their specialization,"
" JPBD is the custodian of landuse information."

"QGIS was first introduced to the Malaysian Open Source community as a viable"
" alternative to proprietary GIS for public agencies by JPBD at the Malaysian"
" Government Open Source Conference (MyGOSSCON) in 2009 and to the Malaysian "
"GIS community at the 4th National GIS Conference and Exhibition (NGIS) in "
"2010. JPBD has traditionally been a user of proprietary GIS thus the "
"introduction of QGIS was a real eye opener not only from the point-of-view "
"of Open Source Software (OSS), what more, OSS GIS. Open source philosophy "
"was different thus QGIS felt alien, unsure and unsafe, not surprisingly the "
"idea to use QGIS did not receive much support internally, in fact, it faced "
"resistance in 2010 from the top managment all the way down to the support "
"group."

"On the opposite side, request for technical talks on QGIS came from other "
"technical agencies which JPBD gave to the Ministry of Works and the "
"Department of Irrigation and Drainage. Other works to promote QGIS from JPBD"
" came in the form of newsletter articles on QGIS to the Open Source "
"Competency Centre (OSCC) at the Prime Minister\\'s Department and articles "
"introducing QGIS to the Survey Department\\'s GIS Bulletin and the Ministry "
"of Natural Resource\\'s Public Sector GeoSpatial Bulletin. In the meantime, "
"JPBD researched on developing a slope analysis module for QGIS\\'s Windows "
"and Ubuntu version."

"The study highlighted pros and cons of customizing a module and the high "
"level of commitment from the management needed to ensure its continual "
"success and adoption. In 2011, JPBD began to further research on QGIS more "
"as an analytical tool rather than a mapping tool in order to pioneer "
"untapped modules or new approaches at exploiting QGIS."

"The department eventually promoted the QGIS-GRASS package instead of merely "
"QGIS as it was found to be most powerful and helpful for town planning "
"purposes such as cleaning topology error and overcoming limitations of the "
"default standard inputs. That was merely the beginning."

"In order to centralize and share findings in the use of QGIS for town "
"planning purpose which could also be use in other fields dealing with "
"spatial analysis, an unofficial blog established by the author called \"QGIS"
" MALAYSIA\" at <http://www.qgismalaysia.blogspot.com> was made to generate a"
" QGIS community in Malaysia. External agencies seem to have more interest in"
" QGIS than JPBD itself and upon their request, JPBD gave QGIS training to "
"the Fire and Safety Department as well as to the Ministry of Education whom "
"later was convinced QGIS will be their de facto GIS tool."

"Hearing this, JPBD\\'s Research and Development Division took the initiative"
" and requested for QGIS training and subsequently 12 persons were trained. "
"Word of mouth (a godsend thing, though at times, extremely detrimental) "
"spread that QGIS was indeed user-friendly, easy to use and at par with "
"proprietary GIS in mapping task and could take on proprietary GIS when "
"optimized with GRASS modules."

"Interest in QGIS stirred and in 2012, with the support of all project office"
" directors, an all-out effort was undertaken by the National Landuse "
"Information Division that spearheaded QGIS to train the 4 project offices as"
" they hold the greatest number of GIS users. By the end of 2012, it is "
"anticipated that at least 320 staff throughout JPBD will use QGIS which "
"accounts for approximately 90 % of GIS users in the department."

"That is not all. States town planning departments have also requested QGIS "
"training such as Perak including strong interest from poorer states like "
"Perlis and Kelantan. If this catches on, it is anticipated that the use of "
"QGIS may dominate states planning departments and even extend to local "
"planning authorities, many of which are not wealthy. In the meantime, JPBD "
"is seriously studying the use of the QGIS-PosgreSQL-PostGIS package for "
"every planning office\\'s client GIS-geodatabase server structure to serve "
"as the foundation of JPBD\\'s integrated landuse (iPLAN) network."
