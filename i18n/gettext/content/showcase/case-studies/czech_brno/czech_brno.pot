"Laboratory on Experimental and Applied Geography (LEAG) is part of College "
"of Hotel and Business Management, Ltd. In Brno, Czech Republic (Vysoká škola"
" obchodní a hotelová, s.r.o.) which offers higher education at tourism, "
"business and hotel management. LEAG is focused on modeling socio-economic "
"spatial processes, analyzing spatial patterns, describing and monitoring the"

"LEAG plays important role in academic research held in College of Business "
"and Hotel Management. The need of spatial modeling requires also excellent "
"software. The philosophy of minimum cost and maximum efficiency led to "
"choice of open source solutions. This step resulted in using core open "
"source SW such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape and QGIS. QGIS does not stand "
"alone --\\-- we use MapWindow, OpenJump, gvSIG, SAGA and others. But QGIS "
"plays the major role."

"QGIS is used with synergy to other open source products. For example the "

"With no cost and high efficiency the Laboratory on Experimental and Applied "
"Geography produces high-quality analysis, maps and visualizations. Using "
"QGIS large databases are being created and further testing of new functions "
"are being done. Finally, one of the highest impact of using QGIS could be "
"seen in education \\-\\-- QGIS is the first software, which is presented to "
"students. During regular workshops students learn how to legally work with "
"QGIS and how to create their own maps."
