"The Fundy Footpath is a wilderness hiking trail located along the Fundy "
"coast of New Brunswick, Canada. It is a charter member of the [UNESCO Fundy "
"Biosphere Reserve](http://fundy-biosphere.ca/en/about-us/the-reserve) and "
"affiliated with the [NB Trails Council Inc.](http://www.sentiernbtrail.com/)"
" and the Trans Canada Trail. The Footpath takes hikers through the coastal "
"Acadian Forest, home to the world's highest tides, old growth forests, and "
"several rare and unique types of flora and fauna."

"The trail was created, is maintained, and promoted by a group of volunteers "
"known as the Fundy Hiking Trail Association Inc. (FHTA)(1975). As a non-"
"profit organization the FHTA raises funds for its activities through the "
"sale of guidebooks that include a trail map. In 2011 I approached the FHTA "
"to volunteer to update the official trail map. As a volunteer creating a map"
" for a non-profit organization QGIS fit the bill as both a tool for editing "
"data and for final map layout. Through the efforts of myself and members of "
"the FHTA the new official map of the Fundy Footpath included with the "
"guidebook was created from start to finish with QGIS."

"Once the data required to create the map was assembled and in a usable "
"format the creation of the final map was started. To create the hiking map "
"data was symbolized and labeled with the symbolization properties dialog and"
" labeled with QGIS's very functional label engine. Once labels and "
"symbolization were in place the map composer tool was run to create the "
"layout. It was very easy to add useful map elements such as a custom north "
"arrow and elevation profile in the print composer. Two layouts were created "
"since it was to be a double-sided map. Once both layouts were created they "
"were exported as PDF files and sent to the printers."

"The hiking map was printed on heavy-duty waterproof paper, folded and "
"inserted in the back of the new edition of the Fundy Footpath Hiker's Guide "
"Book. QGIS was the best and most functional choice for the creation of this "
"map. Being free software the price was right for a volunteer creating a map "
"for a non-profit organization. But the real advantage of QGIS was that it "
"had all of the functionality and tools required to create a highly useful "
"and detailed hiking map from start to finish. I would highly recommend QGIS "
"to both experienced and beginning GIS users alike."
