"Quantarctica (QGIS + Antarctica) was first developed for in-house use at the"
" Norwegian Polar Institute, as a tool for our glaciologists. There was a "
"need for a low or no cost complete GIS with essential datasets ready-to-use,"
" easy-to-use, functionality rich and with offline capabilities. QGIS seemed "
"to be a perfect choice of GIS for the collected datasets."

"Quantarctica has been used to examine geographical data from continental to "
"local scales, for viewing scientific project data on top of base maps or "
"with other scientific datasets, and to prepare maps for publications and "
"proposals. Quantarctica has so far proven to be a great tool, and a very "
"good alternative and supplement to other software used by the researchers. "
"It has provided new opportunities for our researchers in their daily work."

"Since Quantarctica first came in use by our glaciologists three years ago, "
"there has been many requests in the research community outside the institute"
" to share this product, and we started to develop a public and improved "
"version to replace the in-house version. Following Antarctic field testing, "
"and adding new relevant datasets, Quantarctica version 1.0 was finally "
"completed and made available for download in July 2013."

"Quantarctica is to be all about community effort. With contributions we aim "
"to expand with data from other disciplines, such as oceanography, "
"atmospheric sciences, geology and biology, and hope and believe that this "
"tool can be useful for the Antarctic community as a complete Antarctic GIS "
"package."
