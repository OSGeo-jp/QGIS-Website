"Every day, Ottomanists around the world generate valuable materials as "
"components of their scholarly research, but these materials may not be "
"readily available to scholars with similar interests. The purpose of the "
"OpenOttoman (Amy Singer, OpenOttoman: A Collaborative Platform for Digital "
"Scholarship, "
"<https://networks.hnet.org/node/11419/discussions/166360/openottoman-"
"collaborative-platform-digital-scholarship>, 2017) is to stimulate "
"generation of such materials and provide open and convenient access to these"
" materials. The OpenOttoman Portal (<http://> www.openottoman.org) (OOP) is "
"one vehicle for accessing these materials. Materials made available through "
"the OOP include databases, with a prime example being gazetteers of Ottoman "
"world places. Here, we describe the Historical Gazetteer of the Crimea "
"(HGC), a prototype OOP gazetteer that includes populated places, districts, "
"and provinces of Crimea in existence at the end of the Crimean Khanate."

"The primary source of data for the HGC databases is Jankowski's dictionary "
"of pre-Russian places in Crimea (Henryk Jankowski, Historical-Etymological "
"Dictionary of Pre-Russian Habitation Names of the Crimea, Brill, Leiden, "
"2006). This source contains a map showing the locations of 137 populated "
"places, 99 of which have been associated with existing places contained in "
"the GeoNames database. These are the populated place entries in the HGC, "
"with latitude and longitude for these entries being taken from the GeoNames "
"database."

"Jankowski's map also shows boundaries for six provinces and 43 districts. "
"HGC locations for these features are region centroids approximated using "
"boundaries shown on Jankowski's map. The HGC contains entries for 14 of the "
"16 rivers shown on Jankowski's map plus 61 additional rivers included to aid"
" in locating populated places and district and province boundaries."

"Terrain elevation data (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, "
"available at <https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc>) was incorporated into a "
"base map of the region covered by Jankowski's map. District and province "
"boundaries were approximated using Jankowski's map plus terrain features "
"such as rivers, ridge lines, and valleys where boundaries on Jankowski' map "
"were difficult to trace. Gazetteer locations for rivers are river mouth "
"latitude and longitude taken from the GeoNames database. Per Table 1, the "
"HGC includes three separate sets of databases which can be accessed at "
"<http://epublications.marquette.edu/ottoman_crimea/>. This website also "
"provides access to a project named HGC-QGIS-Project.qgs. Opening the project"
" in QGIS yields the result shown in Figure 1. For the KML and shape file "
"rivers databases, rivers were traced in QGIS using the Google Maps physical "
"map."

"Table 2 shows the HGC database fields. Note the manner in which a unique ID "

"Per Table 2, the fields for the district, province, and river databases are "
"the same as the fields for populated places except that the Page field is "
"left blank, since districts, provinces, and rivers do not appear as entries "
"in Jankowski's dictionary. Districts, provinces, and rivers are assigned URL"
" IDs in the same way that they are assigned for populated places. Thus, in "
"Table 2 the Part of field for the populated place Qarağy is the GeoNames URL"
" for Tarɣan, the district in which this place is located. The Code and Class"
" fields use the nomenclature employed in the GeoNames database. Per the "
"example, the P code applies generally to populated places, and the PPLH "
"class (sub-code) applies to historical populated places that no longer "
"exists."

"The Confidence field reflects the confidence level of the data captured in a"

"associated with existing places in the GeoNames database, they are assigned "
"a confidence level of 1. Rivers are also assigned a confidence level of 1, "
"since they have been traced directly from Google Maps."

"While providing a useful gazetteer, a primary purpose of the HGC was to "
"serve as a test bed and use case for how other Ottoman world gazetteers "
"could be incorporated into the OOP. Based on experience gained through this "
"project, a new project has been initiated to geolocate approximately 3,000 "
"populated places, rivers, river fords, rapids, islands, forests, mountains, "
"and valleys found on a set of 17th century maps of Ukraine produced by "
"Guillaume Le Vasseur, sieur de Beauplan. This project directly supports one "
"of the principal investigator's research on the Polish-Lithuanian "
"Commonwealth /Ottoman Empire frontier. More generally, this work responds to"
" the need for gazetteers of the Ottoman world as expressed by the "
"OpenOttoman initiative (<http://openottoman.org>)."
