"In our region, Argentinean Patagonia, we have very few references about the "

"of the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town analyzed by QGIS, tends"

"We started by the observation (inventory), digitizing the cadastral blocks "
"and the green areas (tree´s canopy) using Google Earth satellite images. As "
"a conceptual framework, we lectured about cartographic design, satellite "
"images reading and interpretation, and specially, location analysis to "
"contrast the situation (in m^2^) of the urban green spaces by inhabitant in "
"Rada Villa coastal town, with values suggested by the World Health "
"Organization, WHO (a minimum of 9 m^2^ of green areas, by person, in urban "

msgid ""
"Based in the projection of an average value of 4 inhabitants by cadastral "
"plot, we estimated that the current (2010) urban population Rada Tilly would"
" go up to around 9.600 inhabitants. These people reside in 209 blocks and "
"they represent 157.6 hectares. The average population density would be of 61"
" inhabitants by hectare."

"The total inventoried green areas grow up to 150.736 m^2^ (15 hectares). "
"Reason why we can consider that the green area by inhabitant in the study "
"area is 15.7 m^2^ (the WHO suggested value is 9 m^2^ of green area by "
"inhabitant). This value proves a very favorable situation, as far as the "
"environmental benefits, that trees offer to the inhabitants in this marine "
"coastal town."

"Although the project was an academic exercise of High School, we deeply "
"value the inventory´s results obtained by QGIS. Students worked with all "
"academic rigor and seriousness, showing appropriation of the thematic (urban"

"experience for them and also for the educational staff involved."

"After the project experience we can assure that the FOSS QGIS is an "

" We have such a positive impression of the software that we will start the "
"use of QGIS in our university courses, replacing GIS Proprietary software "
"that we have being using."
