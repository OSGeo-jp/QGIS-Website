"I started applying GIS to my work in biogeography about 10 years ago. "
"Through my graduate internship, PhD work and two other research jobs, I used"
" the proprietary software packages that were available and used at my "
"workplaces \\---- mainly CartaLinx, Idrisi, ArcView and ArcGIS. But I found "
"it rather annoying that we were constantly dealing with license renewal "
"issues, and that I could not use the software away from the workplace unless"
" I acquired my own license."

"It crossed my mind on several occasions that switching to free software "
"would spare me those problems. However, there was prejudice against the "
"analytical capabilities of free software, and even after I heard about the "
"potential of GRASS, I was still reluctant because I thought it would be too "
"difficult to learn. I was also afraid it would be cumbersome to migrate all "
"the maps and analyses that I had done so far. At the beginning of my post-"
"doc in 2008, I finally gave it an opportunity and took a training course on "
"QGIS and GRASS. It was probably the best decision of my professional life! I"
" found that QGIS provided a very intuitive interface for GRASS, hat they "
"complemented each other perfectly, and they provided all the analytical "
"capabilities I needed."

"I started using both programs immediately after the course. Not only did I "
"begin all my new GIS work with QGIS/GRASS \\[e.g. 1, 2\\], but I also did "
"follow-up analyses on previous works that I had done with commercial "
"software. For example, I had built models of otter \\[3\\] and desman "
"\\[4\\] distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. After switching to QGIS-"
"GRASS, I analysed how those models behaved when downscaled to a finer "
"resolution \\[5\\]. Another previous work on biogeographic relationships "
"between Iberian lynx and rabbit \\[6\\] had a follow-up after I switched to "
"QGIS-GRASS \\[7\\]. Not only did I not have any problems with the migration "
"of the data and previous results: I also found it much easier to do the "
"things I wanted to do with the new software, and was able to do extra "
"analyses which I could not have done with the programs I used before."

"All in all, switching to QGIS/GRASS brought me nothing but advantages. I can"
" now work freely at work, at home and on my laptop on the move, without "
"having to worry about software licenses or moving to new institutions. Open-"
"source software covers all my research needs and gives me the freedom I "
"longed for."
