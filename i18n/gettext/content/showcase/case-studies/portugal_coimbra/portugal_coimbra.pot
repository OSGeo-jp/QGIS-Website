"This case study results from the final draft of the Graduate Geographic "
"Information Systems taught by GeoPoint. We proposed to study a landscape "
"using Landscape Ecology plugin (LecoS) in QGIS 2.01 Dufour. The study was "
"conduted in a region of central Portugal, Municipality of Coimbra, with an "
"total area of 31940ha and it has geographic coordinates 40°12\\'11.84\\\" "
"North, 8°24\\'37.15\\\" West. Because the new administrative reorganization "
"this municipality are divided into 18 parishes, which are mostly urban areas"
" (Figure 1)."

"The characterization of a landscape is conducted using quantitative indices "
"designed by landscape metrics. These indices are then used to describe the "
"structural characteristics of landscape, to document the change and their "
"relationship with the occurrence of several species or group of species "
"(Turner et al, 2001;. Olsen et al, 2007;. Fidalgo et al. , 2009). The number"
" of metrics is extremely large and can be calculated at the landscape level,"
" class and stain (Turner et al, 2001;. Fidalgo et al, 2009.). Metrics can be"
" calculated from the Corine Land Cover, Land use (COS 90 and COS2006) or "
"maps of Land cover produced by us. According to Martin Jung (2012), the "
"Landscape Ecology Stistics (Lecos) is a module of QGIS used to calculate "
"landscape metrics in raster layers. The result can be available in CSV "
"format."

"Landscape metrics was calculated using the Corine Land Cover (CLC) of the "
"years 1990 and 2006. For this purpose it was necessary to transform the "
"coverages in raster format with cell size 50x50 meters. We use r.to.raster "
"tool the Grass Gis module that were present in processing toolbox and the "
"CLC classification level used it´s the first. After transform coverages we "
"calculate the metrics in Landscape Ecology plugin (LecoS) using the "
"graphical modeler (Figure 2)."

"From analysis of the landscape metrics calculated it was found that there "
"was an increase in the degree of human disturbance and therefore a greater "
"fragmentation of uses between 1990 and 2006. The number of patches of "
"\"Forest Semi Natural areas\" and \"Agricultural areas\" decreased between "
"1990 and 2006 (Table 1). This metric can give us some indication of "
"ecological processes increasing or decreasing relationships between "
"populations and habitats (Viana and Aranha, 2008). Also of note is the "
"average distance between spots, one measure that allows us to understand the"
" degree of landscape fragmentation, the decline of \"Forest and Semi Natural"
" areas\" 1990 to 2006 at the expense of increased \"Artificial areas\" "
"(Table 1)."

"From 1990 to 2006 diversity increased, however it is known that this result "
"is directly related to the transfer between land cover, in particular loss "
"of \"Agricultural areas\" and \"Forest and Semi Natural areas\". The same "
"happened with uniformity."

msgid ""
"It was possible to determine the landscape metrics using the LecoS plugin "
"noting that the study area presents problems of fragmentation due to the "
"high degree of human disturbance. QGIS proved to be quite intuitive and very"
" practical in the calculation of landscape metrics in the absence of any "
"constraint. It is indeed a robust and viable compared to proprietary "
"software solution. In the future we intend to apply this method to areas "
"that have problems with invasive species to study their behavior in the "
"landscape."
