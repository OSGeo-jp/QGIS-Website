"QGIS is a high impact, global project. QGIS.org provides open access to "
"best-in-class tools for visualising, creating, editing, analysing and "
"publication of spatially linked data and information products. QGIS.org does"
" not prescribe how these tools should be used, but we make these tools "
"freely available and accessible to everyone in order to foster a more just "
"society, the making of better decisions and further the goal of a more "
"sustainable environment. We provide tools for working on traditional desktop"
" PC’s, on mobile devices and in the cloud."

"It has taken, and will continue to take, a great deal of effort to develop "
"high quality tools like those provided at QGIS.org. Initially this cost was "
"borne exclusively through the efforts of dedicated volunteers. As the "
"project matured, a financial ecosystem developed around the project. "
"Customers began to contract community members to extend the QGIS project "
"(software, documentation, online infrastructure) to better serve their "

"Many of our users migrate to QGIS from proprietary alternatives which are "
"financially unsustainable to use within their organisations. We celebrate "
"the fact that we are able to open doors for those needing spatial tools such"
" as QGIS which would have otherwise been closed. However, we also ask you to"
" share some of the value gains that you realise from moving to QGIS with us."
" The funds you provide to us are used to the direct benefit of all users, "
"who get to enjoy a more feature rich, stable and well documented set of QGIS"
" tools. This ‘value for value’ model helps to ensure the long term "
"sustainability and prosperity of the QGIS project. With nearly half a "
"million daily active users, your contributions can make a huge impact to the"
" lives of many people. The project has received in-kind and financial "
"contributions from many well known international organisations around the "
"world, whom we thank deeply. We invite you to join the ever growing number "
"of organisations who see value in the work we do and share value back to us "
"in the form of financial contributions to support our work."
