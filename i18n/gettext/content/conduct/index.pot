"Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to "

"Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for "

"uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the QGIS "

"Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and QGIS is no"
" exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing "
"views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of QGIS "
"comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. "
"Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to "
"understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. "
"Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us "
"anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from "
"mistakes."
