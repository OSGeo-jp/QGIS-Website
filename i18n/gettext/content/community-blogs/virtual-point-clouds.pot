"<h2 id=\"rationale\">Rationale</h2>\n"
"<p>Lidar surveys of larger areas are often multi-terabyte datasets with many billions of points. Having such large datasets represented as a single point cloud file is not practical due to the difficulties of storage, transfer, display and analysis. Point cloud data are therefore typically stored and distributed split into square tiles (e.g. 1km x 1km), each tile having a more manageable file size (e.g. ~200 MB when compressed).</p>\n"

"<p>Tiling of data solves the problems with size of data, but it introduces "
"issues when processing or viewing an area of interest that does not fit "
"entirely into a single tile. Users need to develop workflows that take into "
"account multiple tiles and special care needs to be taken to deal with data "
"near edges of tiles to avoid unwanted artefacts in outputs. Similarly, when "
"viewing point cloud data, it becomes cumbersome to load many individual "
"files and apply the same symbology.</p>\n"

"<p>In the GIS world, many users are familiar with the concept of virtual rasters. A virtual raster is a file that simply references other raster files with actual data. In this way, GIS software then treats the whole dataset comprising many files as a single raster layer, making the display and analysis of all the rasters listed in the virtual file much easier.</p>\n"
