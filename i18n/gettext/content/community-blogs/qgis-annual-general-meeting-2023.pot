"<p>This year, we did not have PSC elections. Anita Graser will continue as "
"Vice-Chair,  I will continue to serve on the PSC as chair, and our "
"longstanding treasurer, Andreas Neumann, will complete the board. "
"Furthermore, Jürgen Fischer, Alessandro Pasotti, and Régis Haubourg will "
"continue on the PSC. Last but certainly not least, the PSC is completed by "
"our project founder, Gary Sherman, and long-term PSC member Tim Sutton, who "
"serve on the PSC as honorary PSC members. They both set the standard for our"
" excellent project culture, and it is great to have his continued "
