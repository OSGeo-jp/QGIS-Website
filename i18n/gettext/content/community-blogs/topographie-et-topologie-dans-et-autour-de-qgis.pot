"<p>Since 2018 and the arrival of LoÃ¯c Bartoletti, Oslandia has accelerated its focus on topography and topology within and around QGIS.</p>\n"
"<p>Two questions have driven this focus:</p>\n"
"<ul class=\"part\">\n"
"<li class=\"\">How to draw directly in GIS by integrating drawing tools inspired by the CAD world into QGIS.</li>\n"
"<li class=\"\">How to integrate plugins for topographic calculations directly into QGIS.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p class=\"part\">To address this, Oslandia has worked on several fronts: training, developing open-source plugins, and improvements in QGIS.</p>\n"
"<h2 class=\"part\">1- Plugins</h2>\n"
"<p>The following plugins were developed by Oslandia or partners, with contributions from Oslandia:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li class=\"part\"><strong>landsurveycodesimport</strong> : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/landsurveycodesimport\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/landsurveycodesimport</a><br />\n"
"A plugin for surveyors working with the point coding methodology in topography.</li>\n"
"<li class=\"part\"><strong>QompliGIS</strong> : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/qompligis\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://gitlab.com/Oslandia/qgis/qompligis</a><br />\n"
"A tool to ensure your dataset or plan complies with a specification.</li>\n"
"<li class=\"part\"><strong>Total Open Station</strong> : <a href=\"https://github.com/totalopenstation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/totalopenstation</a><br />\n"
"An open-source project initiated by Italian and French archaeologists, it is a tool to convert various formats of survey field books.</li>\n"
"<li class=\"part\"><strong>Topaze</strong> : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/azimut-fr/qgis/topaze\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://gitlab.com/azimut-fr/qgis/topaze</a><br />\n"
"A topometric calculation tool developed with Jean-Marie Arsac (Azimut). It was a proof of concept that such calculations can be done within a GIS.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p class=\"part\">These plugins can be used at different stages of a project. They can be used all together or only those needed and integrated into workflows.</p>\n"
"<h2 class=\"part\">2- Improvements on QGIS</h2>\n"
"<p>Oslandia also focuses on improving the core of QGIS. Last years, our teams have worked on:</p>\n"
"<p class=\"part\">â€” Integration of shape tools: circles, ellipses, rectangles, regular polygons, etc.<br />\n"
"â€” Improvement of snapping tools.<br />\n"
"â€” Enhancement of Z and M coordinate support.<br />\n"
"â€” Improvement of topological tools (relationships between geometries).</p>\n"
"<p>Coming soon is the possibility to use geometry and topology validation and correction plugins directly in QGIS processing tools, developed by Jacky VolpÃ¨s and LoÃ¯c Bartoletti.</p>\n"
"<h2 class=\"part\">3- Training</h2>\n"
"<p>Oslandia is QUALIOPI certified and offers a training program around QGIS and QField:</p>\n"
"<ul class=\"part\">\n"
"<li class=\"\">Drawing: Transition from CAD to GIS with QGIS: <a href=\"https://oslandia.com/en/formations/qgis3-dessiner-avec-qgis/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://oslandia.com/formations/qgis3-dessiner-avec-qgis/</a></li>\n"
"<li class=\"\">Topography with QGIS (LSCI, Topaze, QompliGIS, Total Open Station)</li>\n"
"<li class=\"\">QField Training</li>\n"
"<li class=\"\">Deployment of QField Cloud</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p class=\"part\"><em>Â« In 2023, 89 people were trained by Oslandia, who recommend our training at 90.9%.Â»</em></p>\n"
"<h2 class=\"part\">4- And QField ?</h2>\n"
"<p class=\"part\">Since our partnership with <a href=\"http://OPENGIS.ch\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OPENGIS.ch</a>, Oslandia offers QField Cloud server deployment services, training, and QField support.</p>\n"
"<h2 class=\"part\">5- Coming Soon!</h2>\n"
"<p>Several technical posts are being prepared: how to open CAD files in a GIS? What are the differences between QField and LSCI? You will find them on our website in the coming weeks. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n"
"<p>Additionally, we are preparing a white paper on the topic of migrating from CAD to QGIS, which we should release in September.</p>\n"
"<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n"
