"<p>Upon launching this new version of QField, users will be greeted by a "
"revamped recent projects list featuring shiny map canvas thumbnails. While "

"by typing the ‘f’ prefix in the search bar followed by a string or number to"

"<p>QField’s tracking has also received some love. A <strong>new erroneous "
"distance safeguard</strong> setting has been added, which, when enabled, "
"will dictate the tracker not to add a new vertex if the distance between it "
"and the previously added vertex is greater than a user-specified value. This"
" aims at preventing “spikes” of poor position readings during a tracking "
"session. QField is now also capable of resuming a tracking session after "
"being stopped. When resuming, tracking will reuse the last feature used when"
" first starting, allowing sessions interrupted by battery loss or momentary "
"pause to be continued on a single line or polygon "
"geometry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"
