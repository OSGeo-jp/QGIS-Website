"<p>The highlight of QField 2.7 is the <strong>new audio and video recording "

"<p>The experience wouldn‚Äôt be complete without <strong>audio and video "
"playback support</strong>, which we took care of in this version too. "
"Playback of such media content within the feature form gives an immediate "
"feedback and saves time. For those interested in full screen immersion, "
"simply click on the video frame to open the attached in your favorite media "
"player. We also took the opportunity to implement audio and video playback "
"on QGIS so people can easily consume the fruits of their labor in the field "

"when positioning is enabled, double tapping on the lower-left positioning "
