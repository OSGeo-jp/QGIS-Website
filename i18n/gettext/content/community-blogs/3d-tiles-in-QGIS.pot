"<p>3D tiles are a specification for streaming and rendering large-scale 3D "
"geospatial datasets. They use a hierarchical structure to efficiently manage"
" and display 3D content, optimising performance by dynamically loading "
"appropriate levels of detail. This technology is widely used in urban "
"planning, architecture, simulation, gaming, and virtual reality, providing a"
" standardised and interoperable solution for visualising complex "
