"<p>The gift economy of Open Source is community driven and filled by folks with ideas that just go for it!</p>\n"
"<p>We at <strong>North Road</strong> are blessed that we get to join these creatives on their journey in order to get their products to you. Recently, the first <a href=\"https://www.qgis.org/\">QGIS</a> flagship sponsor, <a href=\"https://felt.com/product\">Felt</a>, engaged us to further strengthen their support for the up to <a href=\"https://feed.qgis.org/metabase/public/dashboard/df81071d-4c75-45b8-a698-97b8649d7228\">600,000 daily QGIS users</a> to integrate their workflows between <strong>QGIS</strong> and <strong>Felt</strong>.</p>\n"
"<p>The result is the &#8220;<a href=\"https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/felt/\">Add to Felt&#8221;</a> QGIS Plugin, which makes it super-simple to publish your QGIS maps to the Felt platform.</p>\n"

"<p>To get started, install the <strong>Add to Felt Plugin</strong> from the <strong>QGIS Plugin manager</strong>.</p>\n"
"<p>If you don&#8217;t have a free <strong>Felt</strong> account, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for one <a href=\"https://felt.com/signup\">online</a> (or from the <strong>Add to Felt</strong> plugin itself once you have installed it).</p>\n"
"<p>Within <strong>QGIS</strong>, users can easily publish their maps and layers to <strong>Felt. </strong>You can either:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Publish a single layer by right-clicking the layer and selecting &#8220;Share Layer to Felt&#8221; from the Export sub-menu</li>\n"
"<li>Publish your whole QGIS project/map by selecting the Project Menu, Export, &#8220;Add to Felt&#8221; action</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Whilst <strong>Felt</strong> is loading up your map, you can continue working and it will let you know once your map is ready to open on Felt and share with others.</p>\n"
