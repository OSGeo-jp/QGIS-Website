<p>In this post, Jakub Nowosad introduces our book &#8220;Geocomputation with Python&#8221;, also known as geocompy. It is an open-source book on geographic data analysis with Python, written by Michael Dorman, Jakub Nowosad, Robin Lovelace, and me with contributions from others. You can find it online at <a href="https://py.geocompx.org/" rel="nofollow">https://py.geocompx.org/</a></p>
