<h3>What’s new in a nutshell</h3>
<p>The GRASS GIS 8.3.0 release provides more than <strong>360 changes</strong> compared to the 8.2 branch. This new minor release brings in <strong>many fixes and improvements</strong> in GRASS GIS modules and the graphical user interface (GUI) which now has the <strong>single window layout by default</strong>. Some of the most relevant changes include: support for <strong>parallelization</strong> in three raster modules, new options added to several temporal modules, and substantial clean-up of <code>g.extension</code>, the module that allows the installation of add-ons. The GUI also received a lot of attention with many fixes and items reorganised. We have also adopted the Clang format and indented most of the C code accordingly. A lot of effort was put into cleaning up the C/C++ code to fix almost all compiler warnings.</p>
<p>Translations have been moved from Transifex to <a class="ext" title="Weblate" href="https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/grass-gis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weblate</a>, which automatically creates pull requests with the translated chunks. We’d like to <strong>thank the translators of all languages</strong> for their long term support!</p>

<p>Also, docker images have been updated and moved from the mundialis to the OSGeo organization at <a class="ext" title="https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://hub.docker.com/r/osgeo/grass-gis/</a>.</p>
<p>We have carried out quite some work in the GitHub Actions: we added support for “pre-commit” in order to reduce unnecessary runs of the automated checks, there were notable improvements in the code checking section and we have activated renovatebot to automatically maintain GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have significantly improved the automated release creation to reduce maintainer workload and we have gained nine new contributors! Welcome all!!</p>
