<p>This summer, I had the honor to &#8212; once again &#8212; speak at the OpenGeoHub Summer School. This time, I wanted to challenge the students and myself by not just doing MovingPandas but by introducing both MovingPandas and DVC for Mobility Data Science.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve previously written about DVC and how it may be used to <a href="https://anitagraser.com/2023/02/25/tracking-geoprocessing-workflows-with-qgis-dvc/">track geoprocessing workflows with QGIS &amp; DVC</a>. In my summer school session, we go into details on how to use DVC to keep track of MovingPandas movement data analytics workflow.</p>



<p>Here is the recording of the session live stream and you can find the materials at <a href="https://github.com/movingpandas/movingpandas-examples/blob/opengeohub2023/README.md">https://github.com/movingpandas/movingpandas-examples/blob/opengeohub2023/README.md</a> </p>
