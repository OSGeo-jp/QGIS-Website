<p>Today, Jeff Sikes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://firefish.social/@box464" target="_blank">@box464@firefish.social</a>, alerted me to the fact that &#8220;Twitter has removed all media attachments from 2014 and prior&#8221; (source: <a href="https://firefish.social/notes/9imgvtckzqffboxt">https://firefish.social/notes/9imgvtckzqffboxt</a>). So far, it seems unclear whether this was intentional or a system failure (source: <a href="https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110922114407553901">https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110922114407553901</a>).</p>



<p>Since I&#8217;ve been on Twitter since 2011, this means that some media files are now lost. While the loss of a few low-res images is probably not a major loss for humanity, I would prefer to have some control over when and how content I created vanishes. So, to avoid losing more content, I have followed Jeff&#8217;s recommendation to create a proper archival page:</p>

<p>It is based on an export I pulled in October 2022 when I started to use Mastodon as my primary social media account. Unfortunately, this export did not include media files. </p>

<p>Btw, a recent study published on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02554-0?utm_source=press.coop">Nature News</a> shows that Mastodon is the top-ranking Twitter replacement for scientists. </p>



<p>To find other interesting people on Mastodon, there are many useful tools and lists, including, for example:</p>
