<p>It is with great pleasure that we would like to welcome <a href="https://felt.com/blog/felt-flagship-member-of-qgis">Felt as our first flagship sustaining member</a>!</p>



<p><a href="https://felt.com">Felt</a> plays a revolutionary role for those who work with maps daily by making maps and spatial analysis more accessible across organizations through modern web-based collaboration features. Teams across planning, tech, infrastructure, consulting, environmental sciences and more are using QGIS &amp; Felt to access the power of desktop GIS alongside the ease of modern web-based collaboration features, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Customize your maps with browser-based tools: draw, drop pins, leave notes, trace boundaries, find routes — even add a video — all just point and click</li>



<li>Collaborate with your team on the same map in the moment, or hours and miles apart</li>



<li>Invite one, a few, or the whole world to see your work with precise access controls</li>
</ul>



<p>Have a look yourself and discover the <a href="https://felt.com/gallery">inspiring maps shared by Felt users</a>.</p>



<p>We are particularly excited about this collaboration since Felt users regularly pair the analytical power of QGIS with the team-based sharing and collaboration features of Felt. Together, we contribute to a winning ecosystem of easy-to-use map-making tools for modern teams and organizations. </p>



<p>Felt&#8217;s support for QGIS helps us reach the goal of a stable financial basis to <a href="https://blog.qgis.org/2023/01/16/crowd-funding-call-2023/">ensure another 20+ years of sustainable development</a> and keep bringing the most user-friendly GIS to users worldwide.</p>
