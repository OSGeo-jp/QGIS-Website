<p>Funding for the programme was sourced by you, our <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/about/sponsorship.html">project donors and sponsors</a>! <strong>Note:</strong> For more context surrounding our grant programme, please see: <a href="https://blog.qgis.org/2023/04/04/qgis-grants-8-call-for-grant-proposals-2023/">QGIS Grants #8: Call for Grant Proposals 2023</a>.</p>



<p>The QGIS.ORG Grant Programme aims to support work from our community that would typically not be funded by client/contractor agreements. This means that we did not accept proposals for the development of new features. Instead proposals focus on infrastructure improvements and polishing of existing features.<span id="more-1420"></span></p>



<p>Voting to select the successful projects was carried out by our QGIS Voting Members. Each voting member was allowed to select up to 6 proposals. The full list of votes are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xdgpYwt1g39pRYcCm1XbqNC2yXfb7aXtf_3RALr2PQc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> (on the first sheet). The following sheets contain the calculations used to determine the winner (for full transparency). The table below summarizes the voting tallies for the proposals:</p>

<p>A couple of extra notes about the voting process:</p>



<ul>
<li>Voting was carried out based on the technical merits of the proposals and the competency of the applicants to execute on these proposals.</li>



<li>No restrictions were in place in terms of how many proposals could be submitted per person / organization, or how many proposals could be awarded to each proposing person / organization.</li>



<li>Voting was ‘blind’ (voters could not see the existing votes that had been placed).</li>
</ul>



<p>We received 35 votes from 20 community representatives and 15 user group representatives.</p>



<p>On behalf of the QGIS.ORG project, I would like to thank everyone who submitted proposals for this call!</p>
