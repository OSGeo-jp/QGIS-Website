<p>Dear QGIS Community,</p>
<p>We are very pleased to announce that this year’s round of grants is now available. The call is open to anybody who wants to make a contribution to QGIS funded by our grant fund, subject to the call conditions outlined in the application form.</p>
<p>The deadline for this round is in four weeks, on <strong>2nd May 2023</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are no new procedures in 2023. Please note the following guidelines established in previous years:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The proposal must be submitted as a ‘QEP’ (QGIS Enhancement Proposal) issue in the repo: </span><a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (tagged as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Grant-YEAR</span><span style="font-weight: 400">). Following this approach will allow </span><span style="font-weight: 400">people to ask questions and provide public feedback on individual proposals.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Proposals must clearly define the expected final result so that we can properly assess if the goal of the proposal has been reached.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The project budgets should account for PR reviewing expenses to ensure timely handling of the project-related PRs and avoid delays caused by relying on reviewer volunteer time.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the week after the QEP discussion period, the proposal authors are expected to write a short summary of the discussion that is suitable for use as a basis on which voting members make their decisions.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The PSC of QGIS.ORG will examine the proposals and has veto power in case a proposal does not follow guidelines or is not in line with project priorities. </span></p>
<p>For more details, please read the introduction provided in <a href="https://forms.gle/2iZd23gzqawhXLBS7">the application form</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing all your great ideas for improving QGIS!</p>
