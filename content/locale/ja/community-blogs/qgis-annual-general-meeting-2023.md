<p>Dear QGIS Community,</p>



<p>We recently held our 2023 QGIS Annual General Meeting. The minutes of this meeting are <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/_downloads/0896829f274fa9df076b391c72e1edc4/QGIS-AGM2023-Minutes.pdf">available for all to view</a>.</p>



<p>This year, we did not have PSC elections. Anita Graser will continue as Vice-Chair,  I will continue to serve on the PSC as chair, and our longstanding treasurer, Andreas Neumann, will complete the board. Furthermore, Jürgen Fischer, Alessandro Pasotti, and Régis Haubourg will continue on the PSC. Last but certainly not least, the PSC is completed by our project founder, Gary Sherman, and long-term PSC member Tim Sutton, who serve on the PSC as honorary PSC members. They both set the standard for our excellent project culture, and it is great to have his continued presence.</p>



<p>QGIS has been growing from strength to strength, backed by a fantastic community of kind and collaborative users, developers, contributors and funders. This year, we reached another important milestone for the project&#8217;s sustainability by welcoming <a href="https://blog.qgis.org/2023/03/21/felt-is-our-first-sustaining-member/">our first flagship sustaining member –&nbsp;Felt</a>. I look forward to seeing how it continues to grow and flourish.</p>



<p>Rock on QGIS!</p>



<p>Cheers</p>



<p>Marco Bernasocchi (QGIS.ORG Chair)</p>
