# QGIS User Meetings

##### Do you want to organize a new meeting?
We organize events on the [QGIS wiki](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki#qgis-hackfests).

**Annual User Conference:** We hold an annual user conference with talks and presentations covering a broad range of topics that are presented by users, showcasing how they use QGIS to solve their day to day analysis needs.

**QGIS Open Day:** On the last Friday of every month we hold an informal virtual meeting to engage with the awesome QGIS community. The agenda is dependent on the community and encourages a culture of collaboration and self-organisation - you can add topics that interest you on the event page, or get in touch with the event organisers if you are interested in facilitating a session.
